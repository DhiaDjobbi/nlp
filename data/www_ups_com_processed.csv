The next day we called them to ensure that they had everything they needed and they ensured me that yes, they did, and it would take 24 hours for them to be able to see the documentation in their system. They further said that it would be processed another 24-48 hours after it was entered in their system, that they needed nothing else from us, and that it would not interrupt shipping - that they would simply hold this on the truck until the fees were cleared. We called them the next day to make sure everything was still in order, and to ensure that the form had entered their system as promised. At this time we were told that no, it was not, would not be entered, that they would be unable to process the form as the package had already cleared customs, and that full import duties would apply.

1,Pathetic service,"UPS courier service has provided the most pathetic and unprofessional service I have ever experienced. From start to finish, the entire process was a nightmare, and I strongly urge everyone to avoid using UPS to send parcels, particularly to Pakistan.The UK team is utterly unhelpful and lacks any sense of accountability, while the Pakistani team is nothing short of extortionate. They repeatedly demanded bribes to process my parcel, making the experience even more stressful. Edcel, Shakeel, Yashwa, Umair, and Saliha displayed zero professionalism and were completely unresponsive to my concerns. Instead of resolving the issue, they made it worse, leaving me frustrated and helpless.My parcel (Tracking ID: 1Z7E524X0498998573) faced constant delays, lack of updates, and mismanagement at every stage. The level of customer service was abysmal—there was no communication, no resolution, and absolutely no care for the customer.I cannot emphasize enough how terrible this service is. If you value your time, money, and peace of mind, stay far away from UPS. There are far better and more reliable alternatives out there. This was an infuriating experience, and I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone. Avoid them at all costs!Also, worth mentioning my product is not yet delivered and is lost.",5 days ago,ups courier service provided pathetic unprofessional service ever experienced start finish entire process nightmare strongly urge everyone avoid using ups send parcel particularly uk team utterly unhelpful lack sense accountability pakistani team nothing short extortionate repeatedly demanded bribe process parcel making experience even stressful edcel shakeel yashwa umair saliha displayed zero professionalism completely unresponsive concern instead resolving issue made worse leaving frustrated parcel tracking id 1z7e524x0498998573 faced constant delay lack update mismanagement every stage level customer service communication resolution absolutely care emphasize enough terrible service value time money peace mind stay far away ups far better reliable alternative infuriating experience wish upon anyone avoid cost also worth mentioning product yet delivered lost

Even when a package goes out for delivery and UPS (etc.) set a delivery time window, they almost never actually deliver within that window...I stayed home (on my one day of this month) waiting on a delivery this morning which was supposedly out for delivery by 7:00AM and which had a 7:15AM - 11:15AM delivery window, only for the delivery window to come and go with no package. I updated the the tracking at 12:15PM (one hour past the delivery window) and still showed the original delivery window. I then requested another update and now the delivery window changed to 7:00PM...This happened on nearly every delivery I had over the Xmas delivery period as well...

1,The driver of my package stole it,"The driver of my package stole it, and UPS is doing nothing about it. I had a very expensive computer ordered, with signature required, and it was scheduled to arrive on Thursday (3-day delivery). I made special plans to be home during the time it was to be delivered. While out the night before, the driver came to the house a day early, and left a note saying they would take it to an access point (an access point 4+ miles away from my house, when the UPS facility is less than 1/2 mile from my house - which makes no sense to begin with). However, the driver did not drop it off that night, nor did it get dropped off the next day, and now the status on the package was changed from ""being dropped off at access point"" to ""unknown delay in network; unable to currently give update"". The dude absolutely stole my very nice, very expensive computer and is gaming the system to get away with it. News will be called, and lawyers will be hired.

1,Please stop shipping with UPS,"I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with UPS's consistently unreliable service. In the past year alone, I have experienced at least 15 instances of late deliveries, 1 instances of a lost package, 1 instance of a package delivered with all of the contents broken, and at least 10 instances of incorrect delivery addresses.Most recently, a critical shipment of medical supplies for my father, who is battling cancer, was delayed by UPS. This delay caused significant disruption to his treatment and caused immense stress and anxiety.While other carriers like Amazon and USPS have consistently delivered packages on time, UPS continues to fail to meet basic service expectations. I urge businesses to reconsider their use of UPS and choose more reliable shipping partners.UPS needs to be held accountable for its poor performance and take concrete steps to improve its service quality. This includes investing in better tracking systems, improving driver training, and addressing the systemic issues that lead to these ongoing problems.",6 days ago,writing express extreme dissatisfaction ups consistently unreliable service past year alone experienced least 15 instance late delivery 1 instance lost package 1 instance package delivered content broken least 10 instance incorrect delivery recently critical shipment medical supply father battling cancer delayed ups delay caused significant disruption treatment caused immense stress carrier like amazon usps consistently delivered package time ups continues fail meet basic service expectation urge business reconsider use ups choose reliable shipping need held accountable poor performance take concrete step improve service quality includes investing better tracking system improving driver training addressing systemic issue lead ongoing problem

1,I’ve always had issues with this…,"I’ve always had issues with this company, despite not using them very often. A previous mishap I had were the driver delivered to a nearby house, instead of where I lived, so I went online to use the assistant. The automated assistant basically told me: “The package was delivered, so there’s nothing we can do! But, why don’t you try calling customer service? They will give you more options.”So, I did. And this is basically what a live person in customer service had to say: “The package was delivered, so there’s nothing we can do! But, why don’t you try using our automated chat service? It will give you more options!” UPS loves to pass the blame so they won’t actually have to deal with anything, I swear.More recently, I placed an order for an expensive item to be delivered. The very day the item was to be loaded on the delivery truck, in a city JUST 15 MINUTES AWAY FROM MY LOCATION, my status updates went from “Out for delivery”, to “You will receive updates as soon as possible”, and then “Information unavailable” with a delay slapped on it. How do you go from being out for delivery, since early in the morning, to essentially “Oops, we can’t find your package! File a claim!”And attempting to file a claim does nothing but show an error—of which UPS then tells you to take the issue to the package sender, which is what? Them passing the blame onto someone else. They sure love playing ping-pong, don’t they?There is a HUGE and constant issue with people’s items intentionally being stolen before loaded onto trucks, yet UPS has done nothing to stop this, and what’s worse, they might be the only option a seller may utilize for shipments—which ALSO sucks. It would have me believe some party, other than the obvious parcel-theives, are benefiting from the losses. There’s no other reason to keep supporting, and using, a carrier you KNOW will lose or damage things on purpose. I also find it hilarious that I haven’t yet found a way to leave/view any, more widely known about and in your face, Google reviews for this company. Must be a reason for that—yet, they are still in business with a chokehold on the market.And UPS, if you plan to respond to this review, please DO NOT suggest your site’s automated chat bot. It is USELESS. So is phoning customer service. Stop passing the blame around and start cracking down on this problem. And actually help people!! My latest package has been missing/stolen—oh excuse me, under the status “““Information unavailable”””—for THREE DAYS. You don’t just misplace something so nearby to its delivery destination to the effect it needs to be missing for three days!! That’s practically the equivalent of picking up your car keys before heading out the door, but instead of unlocking your car you eat the keys instead and go “Whoops! I seem to have lost my keys!

Tracking information says package was loaded on Truck for delivery 11pm on the 17th and our for delivery on 1/18  by 7 pm  waited all day because I did not want the package sitting out on the step. periodic tracking all said out for delivery. 7pm came and went virtual assistant is a joke no real information just automated responses but it did say residential deliveries until 9pm  9pm came and went ,kept checking the supposed up to the minute tracking it said out for delivery tried calling but after numerous automated selections I was told the office was closed and no one to talk to.  I called the vendor of the item I purchased they had the same info saying package was out for delivery.  Finally at 10:02 when I checked tracking  it said delivery delayed new delivery date when available. No delivery on Sun Mon is a holiday so Tues at the earliest after I waited all day.  Also the supposed reason for delay is weather like sever other complaints.  Again There areno weather issues roads are all clear no precipitation it's cold can they not deliver in the cold,  I will add I have nothing but issues with UPS usually they deliver to the wrong address and it's up to me to figure  out where it is. they do not help.  Also I have had several occasions where fragile perishable items  have been mishandled and damaged.  I have never had a problem with Fed Ex or the USPS.  Enough is Enough from now on before I buy something that needs to be shipped I will ask who the shipper is and if it is UPS I will not make the purchase .. It's not worth it.","Jan 19, 2025",worst company ever reading previous review issue much tracking information say package loaded truck delivery 11pm 17th delivery 7 pm waited day want package sitting step periodic tracking said delivery 7pm came went virtual assistant joke real information automated response say residential delivery 9pm 9pm came went kept checking supposed minute tracking said delivery tried calling numerous automated selection told office closed one talk called vendor item purchased info saying package delivery finally checked tracking said delivery delayed new delivery date available delivery sun mon holiday tues earliest waited day also supposed reason delay weather like sever complaint areno weather issue road clear precipitation cold deliver cold add nothing issue ups usually deliver wrong address figure help also several occasion fragile perishable item mishandled damaged never problem fed ex usps enough enough buy something need shipped ask shipper ups make purchase worth
1,I am extremely disappointed with UPS's…,"I am extremely disappointed with UPS's international shipping service. I entrusted UPS to deliver an important package overseas, but the experience has been nothing short of frustrating. The delivery was delayed by several days without any proper updates or clear explanation.Despite paying a premium for their service, the tracking information was inconsistent, and customer support was unhelpful and vague about the cause of the delay. I understand that international shipping can be complex, but UPS should take responsibility for ensuring timely delivery or, at the very least, provide reliable communication.What’s worse is that the delay caused significant inconvenience on my end, as the package was time-sensitive. This is unacceptable for a company that markets itself as a leader in logistics. I expected better from UPS, but unfortunately, they fell far below expectations. I will seriously reconsider using their service in the future",6 days ago,extremely disappointed ups international shipping service entrusted ups deliver important package overseas experience nothing short frustrating delivery delayed several day without proper update clear paying premium service tracking information inconsistent customer support unhelpful vague cause delay understand international shipping complex ups take responsibility ensuring timely delivery least provide reliable worse delay caused significant inconvenience end package unacceptable company market leader logistics expected better ups unfortunately fell far expectation seriously reconsider using service future

1,Worst shipping company ever,"May God watch over the packages delivered by UPS! But even that might not help anymore… It’s horror and chaos if your package ends up with them—it’s a total nightmare. Others have already written about the problems with them, and I’ve experienced the exact same issues myself.They OPEN the packages!!! And not like customs does… Someone actually opens them, unpacks them, and doesn’t even bother to reseal them. I can only imagine that if it had been a graphics card inside, it would have mysteriously disappeared… I have no idea what their warehouse worker or courier is looking for, but the fact that all eight of my packages were opened and checked in such a sloppy way is 100% certain. I’ve ordered internationally before, even from outside the EU, but I’ve never experienced anything like this in my life.The worst part of all this is that even Amazon uses them for shipping, which completely shocked me… Every single one of my packages was broken, but of course, Amazon sent replacements. The problem is, time passes, and you actually need what you’ve purchased. Not a single package was delivered to me undamaged, and every single delivery had issues. I had to email them for every single package to ensure delivery. You get a generic notification saying they couldn’t find the recipient (I was working from home, you clueless fools—at least call the person if you don’t ring the doorbell, honk, or make your presence known at all). If you don’t email them, they won’t deliver your package!

1,Just End UPS,"At what point is someone just going to disband UPS as a company, because I have never seen so many low reviews for one company on Trustpilot - clearly they are the most ineffective courier service ever! I spent a total of $160 and paid a massive $70 dollars shipping for an order placed on 19/12/2024, which I have not received to date. I begged the owner of the store to stop using UPS, as they are utter garbage (widely regarded), and have had my parcel in a warehouse for 2 weeks now without moving (last scan in a UPS tracking was in a warehouse on 03/01/2025). Since 03/01/2025, UPS has stopped scanning or giving any tracking updates, so I have no idea if I will ever receive my package. Maybe some of their staff is thieving, who knows, it doesn't't make sense. I have had no response from UPS to my enquiries and requests for an update, I even joined the advanced tracking (UPS My Choice), which is the most rubbish feature, the homepage after logging in won't even load up. I don't know whois running UPS these days, but it just seems like one big scam for the money you pay. People are spending har-earned money for products from all over the world and I don't care what kind of business you are running, unless you're shady, if a customer pays $70 for shipping, it is with the implicit expectation that they will receive something for all of that money. Around the same time, I made similar orders from two other stores that use USPS (US Postal Service), and I received both orders on time, so my advice to any customers and sellers is to use USPS instead for shipping from US to UK - super reliable, full tracking, and received within 5 days of store's dispatch. I was under the impression UPS was a legit store, but I simply have nothing to back that up from recent experience, because I've received nothing for all the money spent, and no-one will respond to my messages for a resolution. It's pretty shocking, and mentally distressing, and financially destructive. So thanks UPS for stripping me of over $70 during the holiday period, a great way to go into 2025! Honestly? 1 Star is too much.","Jan 17, 2025",point someone going disband ups company never seen many low review one company trustpilot clearly ineffective courier service ever spent total 160 paid massive 70 dollar shipping order placed received date begged owner store stop using ups utter garbage widely regarded parcel warehouse 2 week without moving last scan ups tracking warehouse since ups stopped scanning giving tracking update idea ever receive package maybe staff thieving know make sense response ups enquiry request update even joined advanced tracking ups choice rubbish feature homepage logging wo even load know whois running ups day seems like one big scam money pay people spending money product world care kind business running unless shady customer pay 70 shipping implicit expectation receive something money around time made similar order two store use usps u postal service received order time advice customer seller use usps instead shipping u uk super reliable full tracking received within 5 day store dispatch impression ups legit store simply nothing back recent experience received nothing money spent respond message resolution pretty shocking mentally distressing financially destructive thanks ups stripping 70 holiday period great way go 2025 honestly 1 star much

The driver just got the package and went up to my front porch. Didn't see anyone and then just left. Didn't as I think wait at all. I didn't even as well hear the doorbell. I would have went right to the door hearing the doorbell. I then read that they can't ring it because of that they are in  a time limit on getting deliveries out fast. To me I think its BS BIG TIME. So what we are suppose to look out the window at every cost. BS BIG TIME once again. Of we have our own things going on. LIke I don't have kids. But what if you were busy with them. Or just in general you are busy in the middle of something and loose time. I didn't feel well and I lay down like I said. My parents weren't home they were with my brother in his car. So all in all of everything. UPS SUCKS. They don't care about their customers one bit. Only about getting the order out in a fashionable manner.

On October 21st 2024 I have paid 81,86€ to ship my parcel from Romania to UK, including 5€ insurance with a declared value of 200€. On October 25th I finally got an email from UPS asking me for clearance information. I have replied the same day to their email, but they only shipped it out of Romania on the 28th. On their site it said the parcel should areive in November the 1st, but then it got delayed to November the 4th. Every day I checked the site with my tracking number to see updates and they kept delaying my shipment everyday. Only on 7th of November a notification showed up when I entered the tracking page saying ""UPS is missing information needed to clear this shipment."" BULLSHIT!

After this they tried to deliver it asking for 80.25 GBP. I was never informed about any extra cost such as duty VAT and disbursement. This alone is a scam, but the fact that they did not even contact me before trying to deliver it and ask the receiver to pay for the fees is just stupid. And what even is disbursement snd why does it cost 14£? Are you this desperate to scam me that you have to add non sense fees? YOU HAVEN'T EVEN ASKED ME TO PAY FOR THE YAXES THEN YOU CHARGE ME BECAUSE YOU PAID THEM ON MY BEHALF?

This prevents UPS from giving a refund for failing to deliver overnight. I would understand if there was actual weather in Louisville, but this felt made up.

1,A Complete Disgrace: Avoid USP Parcel Deliveries at All Costs,"If I could give a negative star rating, I would. My experience with USP Parcel Deliveries has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I feel compelled to warn others about their shocking incompetence and lack of accountability.In 1981, I had the honor of winning the Berlin Marathon—a moment that remains one of the proudest achievements of my life. The trophy I received is a priceless keepsake, and when the marathon organizers asked to display it for the 2024 event, I agreed, trusting it would be handled with care. Unfortunately, USP Parcel Deliveries proved that trust was gravely misplaced.On its return journey, my trophy was severely damaged, and the handling of the matter since has been appalling. USP has taken over five months to respond to my complaint, only to pass the blame onto the shipper, claiming the packaging was inadequate. How they arrived at this conclusion without ever seeing the packaging is beyond me. When the trophy was returned to me, the packaging was more than sufficient—wrapped meticulously with bubble wrap and secured with polystyrene blocks. It took me considerable effort to unpack it myself.To make matters worse, it’s clear the package was tampered with during transit. The original packaging had been opened and resealed with different tape, and the trophy’s base was inexplicably removed. Someone had clearly attempted to dismantle and “repair” the trophy, compounding the damage.A structural engineer I consulted confirmed that, given the robustness of the packaging and the construction of the trophy, the extent of the damage could only have been caused by something severe, such as being struck by a forklift. Despite this, USP insists they bear no responsibility, refusing to provide compensation and hiding behind baseless claims about inadequate packaging.The delivery itself was another fiasco. The package, booked to arrive on a Monday, inexplicably disappeared for an entire day and was only delivered on Wednesday, with no explanation given for the delay. Throughout this ordeal, I had to chase USP for updates, which were either ignored or woefully inadequate.As someone who runs a business and regularly receives parcels without issue, this experience has been eye-opening. USP’s disregard for their customers, lack of accountability, and cavalier attitude toward priceless items are utterly unacceptable.If you are seriously considering using USP Parcel Deliveries, think again. Their service is abysmal, and their approach to resolving issues is even worse. My priceless trophy—an irreplaceable piece of my history—was entrusted to them and returned irreparably damaged. You have been warned: use this company at your own peril.","Jan 9, 2025",could give negative star rating would experience usp parcel delivery nothing short nightmare feel compelled warn others shocking incompetence lack 1981 honor winning berlin moment remains one proudest achievement life trophy received priceless keepsake marathon organizer asked display 2024 event agreed trusting would handled care unfortunately usp parcel delivery proved trust gravely return journey trophy severely damaged handling matter since appalling usp taken five month respond complaint pas blame onto shipper claiming packaging inadequate arrived conclusion without ever seeing packaging beyond trophy returned packaging meticulously bubble wrap secured polystyrene block took considerable effort unpack make matter worse clear package tampered transit original packaging opened resealed different tape trophy base inexplicably removed someone clearly attempted dismantle repair trophy compounding structural engineer consulted confirmed given robustness packaging construction trophy extent damage could caused something severe struck forklift despite usp insists bear responsibility refusing provide compensation hiding behind baseless claim inadequate delivery another fiasco package booked arrive monday inexplicably disappeared entire day delivered wednesday explanation given delay throughout ordeal chase usp update either ignored woefully someone run business regularly receives parcel without issue experience usp disregard customer lack accountability cavalier attitude toward priceless item utterly seriously considering using usp parcel delivery think service abysmal approach resolving issue even worse priceless irreplaceable piece entrusted returned irreparably damaged warned use company peril

I Had to find and print the forms after contacting UPS.The packet was collected at 2.45pm. On the 19th after the GUARANTEED delivery time the UPS tracker  showed the item was still in a warehouse near Stansted Airport since 10pm the previous night. I phoned and asked why it was still in the UK? The advisor said ""they had not entered the data on the system"" so it was awaiting despatch to Germany. I raised a complaint and asked for a full refund. On 31st December they emailed me to say the item was delivered on the 23rd ...3 days after the guaranteed delivery time. They said they couldn't pay a refund until they ""completed an investigation"".  On 7th January they emailed me again claiming they were still investigating.....but they didn't say what they were investigating!! There is of course nothing to investigate. They had failed to deliver to contract. I can see that there are multiple failures on UPS's part including clueless or poorly trained advisors with limited IT system access, a website that doesnt work, failure to action their processes and that they weren't even aware that the the item had been delivered on the 23rd as at  31st December.  Now some 3 weeks after the delivery date they appear to be hoping to blame the customer for their multiple failures and breach of their own contract terms. My item was time critical and that's why I paid for this premium  service. Their failure to deliver on their promise has had serious personal consequences for me. And now they are stalling the  refund. I have lost all faith in UPS. My advice is to think twice about taking a UPS service. And don't trust anyone in UPS. I hope the UPS CEO reads this honest review and sorts out the company training and customer service. And refunds me failing to deliver on the contracted service.","Jan 7, 2025",ups failed deliver small packet uk germany next day 0900 international express plus service 19th december website work 17th december book next day collection called help gave collection code said driver would pick 3pm the18th pay driver cash driver would form required complete truck chase 2pm driver shown arrive waybill truck invoice form international eu delivery find print form contacting packet collected 19th guaranteed delivery time ups tracker showed item still warehouse near stansted airport since 10pm previous night phoned asked still uk advisor said entered data system awaiting despatch germany raised complaint asked full refund 31st december emailed say item delivered 23rd 3 day guaranteed delivery time said could pay refund completed investigation 7th january emailed claiming still investigating say investigating course nothing investigate failed deliver contract see multiple failure ups part including clueless poorly trained advisor limited system access website doesnt work failure action process even aware item delivered 23rd 31st december 3 week delivery date appear hoping blame customer multiple failure breach contract term item time critical paid premium service failure deliver promise serious personal consequence stalling refund lost faith ups advice think twice taking ups service trust anyone ups hope ups ceo read honest review sort company training customer service refund failing deliver contracted service
1,"Horrible, they expect me, with special needs, to walk through bad circumstances due to cold weather to get my package.","The UPS driver failed to deliver my package at the side of my apartment door in my building. Instead, they put it in the Management office, in my apartment complex! I'm special needs and I can't always make it there, I have to walk around the apartment complex to reach the Management office since I can't use the multiple stairs, but in cold weather when there is ice, I can't make it there at all since I don't want to get hurt trying to walk avoiding the ice. Again, I'm  special needs! I can't walk there on ice and I can't drive! It takes me a bit to get there when I can't walk on the multiple stairs around the complex! I call UPS customer service and all the foreign accented woman told me is to go to the office to get it there since it's delivered there, regardless of me unable to make it to the office. They said that there are special rules for the building which is why the driver put it there and my apartment door, then why were they able to deliver my mom's big package to my door months ago?! I see many people get packages delivered outside of the Management office as well, so there isn't really a ""rule"" in my apartment complex.Now my mom has to go and get the package from Management after work since I can't get there myself. I think these carriers are just lazy and if they feel like actually delivering a package outside of the Management office they'll do so, again if they feel like it. They don't care if you have mobility issues or are special needs. They don't care if I have a possibility of getting hurt on ice in cold weather.

2,Cost-better customer service-Think,"I frequent this UPS all the time, the customer service from the young ladies and gentlemen are very exceptional. Unfortunately I was not served by one of them on the date I went in, it was their operations manage this time. He was not customer friendly as I expected him, to be for the busieness I was giving the company. He went over the cost of shipping my holiday packages, and I felt like he was only concerned about what he could charge me for the company. It is very imporant for us as customers to read the confirm section they ask us to review, because I was charged a fee, it was not much for a donation to the Junior Achievement, which was on my receipt. Because I did not read the confirmation before I excepted it I was not aware of the charge. I feel like that should be mentioned to us as customers, even with the holiday season, we are all in a hurry, and if your like me , I don't like to hold people up in lines at any time. So I feel like I was taken advangtage of by this gentleman. His service with me a truly put a damper on UPS at this location I have frequent. UPS you have go to do better, think about how you would feel if that was your family member being taken advantage of in anyway.  Care more about each other.","Dec 24, 2024",frequent ups time customer service young lady gentleman exceptional unfortunately served one date went operation manage time customer friendly expected busieness giving company went cost shipping holiday package felt like concerned could charge company imporant u customer read confirm section ask u review charged fee much donation junior achievement receipt read confirmation excepted aware charge feel like mentioned u customer even holiday season hurry like like hold people line time feel like taken advangtage gentleman service truly put damper ups location frequent ups go better think would feel family member taken advantage anyway care

1,UPS offers a very SUBPAR service,"I was scheduled to receive a xmas gift I had purchased abroad. UPS apparently tried to deliver it twice and failed, but never notified me. I was at home during those delivery attempts.After a last delivery attempt, they sent me an email communication stating that the package is on its way back to the sender in a different country. Called customer support to ask why I did not receive any calls if my phone number is given as part of the delivery address. The answer is that 'drivers are not required to use their personal phones to call recipients'.It is also impossible to give feedback to them, as the only way to file a complaint is if they lose the package, or it arrives damaged.All in all, very subpar. Delivery attempts were failed because the intercom in my building was not working during those days. Other delivery companies kindly reached out to my phone and we could meet at the entrance of the building for me to pick up my parcels.UPS did not try to contact me, even it is obvious the intercom doesn't work. Neither they sent me any notification until the last delivery attempt when it was too late. Their mobile app and website also don't work properly and while trying to sort it out online all I got was technical error messages. Awful.

5,Above and Beyond,"I want to take a moment to recognize the outstanding service provided by Michael Dobbs, a UPS delivery driver in my area. Michael has consistently demonstrated superb customer service and an exceptional work ethic, going above and beyond to ensure that deliveries are handled with care and professionalism.On one occasion, he delivered a couch to my back garage. When I stepped out to open the garage and retrieve my dolly, Michael returned from his truck and kindly offered to assist. Without hesitation, he lifted and slid the box into my home—a gesture that saved me considerable effort and demonstrated his attentiveness and willingness to go the extra mile.Another time, he delivered a very large box to my front door and lifted it into the doorway for me. This act may have seemed minor to him, but it was incredibly significant for me, as I have a condition that affects my legs, despite my youthful appearance. His kindness and consideration truly made a difference.In today’s world, it’s all too common for customers to focus on poor service, but I wanted to take the time to highlight Michael's exceptional service, pleasant demeanor, and hard work. His efforts are a testament to what great customer service looks like—especially in a climate where even basic courtesy can sometimes feel rare.I hope UPS management sees this review and ensures that Michael’s dedication and hard work do not go unnoticed. He is a shining example of the kind of employee who elevates the reputation of the company and leaves a positive impact on customers like me.

We’re calling again this morning to ask them to contact the driver to drop it off at their closest location so we can pick it up and leave for our vacation. After multiple phone calls with the most incapable people I’ve ever dealt with in my life they say they are unable to contact the driver and the package will be delivered sometime before 9pm (or we hope because apparently the two other times the driver couldn’t bring themselves to ring our apartment and walk into the lobby).

1,Taking advantage of people during the holidays and during a strike,"I went to the UPS store in Denman Mall here in Vancouver. We’ve had  a federal postal strike in Canada and I really needed to mail off an important document to my Union. I’ve bern to this store before for computer, fax and express mail stuff before. I knew they were a bit pricey, but my experience tonight was ridiculous. There was one guy working and about 8 people wanting service. The store was a mess with boxes littered all across the floor. People couldn’t move in there and were bumping into each other. The one worker was over whelmed and kept apologizing. He was very disorganized as we all were waiting to mail off letters and send gifts with their mail service. I had to grab a pen behind his desk because he was busy helping someone else. I filled out my envelope and when it was my turn he told me I needed to fill out another form…he did this with everyone which I thought was a waste of time when UPS could have had those forms and pens  out and excesible for all people to fill out while he was busy with other customers. Finally, after a 25 min wait I got up to the workers desk again and I asked him how much it would cost to mail off a single page letter locally to my Union her in Vancouver. I aLeo asked him what my options were? He told me there was only one option to send it express and it would cost me $35 plus tax. I was shocked! The woman before sent out a whole box filled with gifts for $75 and she was sending it to a different province, For a one page letter I was expecting $10 maybe $15 it was a single page letter and being delivered locally. There was no way I was paying that! I remember thinking is UPS using the postal strike and Christmas to rip people off? Also none of their prices weee listed in a price board, I found the store to be extremely disorganized, short staffed for the Christmas season, unprofessional staff, messy interior, no pens or execible  forms to fill out and they wasted my time. I even shared this with the one worker there, but he didn’t seem genuinely sincere and he just kept apologizing almost as a way to get ride if me.

1,UPS - Frustrating Tracking and Limited Delivery Control,"UPS.com is hands down the worst website. Anytime I ordered something online and they send me tracking info and I see it is coming vis UPS. I'm incredibly disappointed with UPS's online service. Here are two major issues that have made my recent experiences incredibly frustrating:1. Inaccurate and Unreliable Tracking:Out of date information: UPS tracking updates are often sluggish and inaccurate. It's incredibly frustrating to see the same scan message for days, leaving me completely in the dark about the whereabouts of my package.No explanation for delays: Tracking rarely offers any explanation for delays. Is it stuck at a facility? Is there a delivery issue? I'm left guessing and worrying.2. Non-functional ""Change My Delivery"" Option:Useless feature: The ""Change My Delivery"" option on the UPS website seems like a great idea, but it simply doesn't work. I've tried to redirect packages to a pick-up location or hold them at a facility, but the system never processes the request. It often redirects me to keep signing-in. Forced to rely on customer service via their chat feature: That's a negative review in itself...Overall, UPS's online tracking and delivery management system feels outdated and unreliable.

1,From a pro CDL delivery driver send…,"From a pro CDL delivery driver send this to your corporate customer service. Second thought. I’ll do it for you. “UPS Delivery Discrepancy: A Problem on Their EndA delivery discrepancy with UPS has highlighted an issue on their end, not mine as the consignee. As the recipient of the goods, my role is clearly defined: to receive and take ownership of the shipment once it has cleared the necessary steps, such as customs, and any required import duties or taxes have been addressed. However, the current situation reveals that the breakdown is within UPS’s handling of the transportation process.To clarify, the consignee is only responsible for being present to collect the shipment unless alternative arrangements have been made. Yet UPS’s role as the carrier includes ensuring the accurate delivery of goods to the consignee. Any failure to deliver properly or to resolve a discrepancy falls squarely on UPS, not the consignee. Ownership of the goods is transferred only after full payment to the consignor, which means UPS’s responsibility lies in fulfilling the agreed transportation terms—not shifting blame onto the recipient.Additionally, UPS must recognize their role in the logistics chain alongside the consignor and consignee. Whether this involves ensuring proper tracking, documentation, or communication, these are responsibilities they are obligated to fulfill. Delays, miscommunications, or errors in handling goods cannot be attributed to the consignee, as the consignee is merely the recipient of the goods, not the cause of transportation or logistical errors.The issue at hand demonstrates a mismanagement on UPS’s part, and any resolution needs to be addressed by their team. They are the designated carrier, responsible for ensuring that the shipment is delivered correctly to the intended recipient. The consignee’s legal role does not include remedying errors caused by the carrier, meaning UPS must resolve this discrepancy promptly and professionally.”","Dec 14, 2024",pro cdl delivery driver send corporate customer service second thought ups delivery discrepancy problem enda delivery discrepancy ups highlighted issue end mine consignee recipient good role clearly defined receive take ownership shipment cleared necessary step custom required import duty tax addressed however current situation reveals breakdown within ups handling transportation clarify consignee responsible present collect shipment unless alternative arrangement made yet ups role carrier includes ensuring accurate delivery good consignee failure deliver properly resolve discrepancy fall squarely ups consignee ownership good transferred full payment consignor mean ups responsibility lie fulfilling agreed transportation shifting blame onto ups must recognize role logistics chain alongside consignor consignee whether involves ensuring proper tracking documentation communication responsibility obligated fulfill delay miscommunications error handling good attributed consignee consignee merely recipient good cause transportation logistical issue hand demonstrates mismanagement ups part resolution need addressed team designated carrier responsible ensuring shipment delivered correctly intended recipient consignee legal role include remedying error caused carrier meaning ups must resolve discrepancy promptly professionally

Half of this companies drivers can't seem to find the addresses they are looking for and as a result deliveries aren't delivered to people door like they are supposed to be. Instead you have to drive to your local store before they send you package back to the sender. They do not like to deal with the people that are receiving the package and only want to talk to the sender. We'll the sender isn't the one having the issues the receiver is. Their automato system does not deal with postacodes. And will only deal with zip codes, and in canada, we don't have zip codes.We have post codes which their automated system doesn't recognize and leaves you stuck in a lurch. If I can help it, I will never use this company again if I am getting a package from somebody that uses this company.I will demand a different company from now on. I suggest that if you want your package delivered to your house. Do not use this company. Boycott this company at all costs. I will be boycotting this company from this day Forward.","Dec 14, 2024",everytime use company nothing issue seeing 1 star rating experience wondering still getting business half company driver ca seem find address looking result delivery delivered people door like supposed instead drive local store send package back sender like deal people receiving package want talk sender sender one issue receiver automato system deal postacodes deal zip code canada zip post code automated system recognize leaf stuck lurch help never use company getting package somebody us demand different company suggest want package delivered house use company boycott company cost boycotting company day forward

It is not rocket science to deliver a package!On the 8th. of december I recieve notice from UPS that my package will be delivered on the 11th. between 1215-1615.On the 10th. I recieve notice of a change in status, it will now be delivered on the 10th. between 1215-1615. I cancel an appointment to be home. A little later I notice additionel info that the package is delayed one day. That is mixed signals? So I call customer service. It will now be delivered on the 11th. is the message. But why then send me a status update when it was already the information I had recieved earlier?Today on the 11th. the supposed day of delivery (between 1215-1615 remember!), I take my mother to the hospital for a check-up. While there I recieve a new message from UPS, time of delivery is now still the 11th., but between 1420-1620. What I only realize later is that UPS tried to deliver the package at 11.06! I was home from the hospital at 11.45, ready in the allocated time slot YOU told me it would be delivered!So I once again call customer support and the message is ""too bad"", you were not home so it will be delivered the next day or you can pick it up. Standard shipping for some reason gives UPS the right to deliver all day.....but why then send me a time interval at all?When I talk to customer service (what a joke name), no manager has the guts to talk to me. When I check trustpilot.dk, many people have had the same problems and it is now no longer possible to write a review because you have shut down your webpage in Denmark.Your service is terrible and I will never choose UPS willingly again. I have also written to the company who sent me my package, advicing them to not use UPS.You are holding your customers packages hostage, with no real posibility to complain or actually recieve proper service. It is a disgrace and I would advice you to go over your messaging system and actually deliver in the delivery ""window"" you youself inform your customers about, as a bare minimum, to minimize customer frustration in the future. It is also really unfair towards your customer representatives as they get all the ""heat""Today I spoke to Jon and Oskar, and it is not fair that they have to listen to me shouting on the phone because no one higher up has the guts to speak with an actual customer.I am still fuming by the lack of basic service from UPS....","Dec 11, 2024",going ups rocket science deliver package 8th december recieve notice ups package delivered 11th 10th recieve notice change status delivered 10th cancel appointment home little later notice additionel info package delayed one day mixed signal call customer service delivered 11th message send status update already information recieved earlier today 11th supposed day delivery remember take mother hospital recieve new message ups time delivery still realize later ups tried deliver package home hospital ready allocated time slot told would delivered call customer support message bad home delivered next day pick standard shipping reason give ups right deliver day send time interval talk customer service joke name manager gut talk check many people problem longer possible write review shut webpage service terrible never choose ups willingly also written company sent package advicing use holding customer package hostage real posibility complain actually recieve proper service disgrace would advice go messaging system actually deliver delivery window youself inform customer bare minimum minimize customer frustration future also really unfair towards customer representative get heat today spoke jon oskar fair listen shouting phone one higher gut speak actual still fuming lack basic service ups

They left a note saying there was 2nd attempt to deliver with no further information. I was at home both times!2. I received zero email or sms updates as I usually would for other shipping companies. 3. I tried to go online and opt to pre-sign so they could leave package unattended. I had to go through so many hoops with no outcome. I needed to make an account with password to make any changes to the delivery. It took me trying 10 different passwords for them to accept my account. Then entering the invoice notice number, the page would not load. They suggested I refresh. Did not work. I tried multiple devices, did not work.4. I tried to call their customer service number, I called 3 times and each time it rang out. Absolutely ridiculous. Never use this company!

1,Mailed UPS package via Staples,"Mailed UPS packages via Staples. I added insurance to my package because UPS only covers up to $100 included in their price. Staples was kind enough to add “fragile” stickers to the box that was over $114 to ship. The packages I shipped arrived at my home in another state and the package that had the extra insurance with all the fragile stickers looked as if it was deliberately dropped from a 10 story building. Arrived broken was a very well bubble wrapped 100+ year old brass wall clock. The solid brass around this clock was so crushed that the mishandling of this package had to be deliberate. The day the packaged arrived I tried to file a claim with UPS. I was almost done with the claim (which was no easy chore) when I was asked for my account number. After spending 45 minutes opening an account and filling out all the questions there was no account number anywhere.

1,One of the worst delivery services,"One of the worst delivery services. I paid $124.40 for shipping and never received the package. Also often Simply terrible service, they charged  an additional fee despite the fact that they had already paid a lot for delivery. It’s also a terrible bureaucratic procedure; you have to fill out a bunch of unnecessary paperwork that isn’t necessary with other services or with regular mail.  Parcels with this service also take an awfully long time to clear customs with express delivery costing more than $100 and even longer deliver than in other cheaper services or even regular mail.  They constantly deceive clients and always force them to pay unnecessary and extra commissions. In general, I do not recommend this service! Even cheaper services or simple mail are many times better in my many years of experience!","Dec 9, 2024",one worst delivery service paid shipping never received package also often simply terrible service charged additional fee despite fact already paid lot delivery also terrible bureaucratic procedure fill bunch unnecessary paperwork necessary service regular mail parcel service also take awfully long time clear custom express delivery costing 100 even longer deliver cheaper service even regular mail constantly deceive client always force pay unnecessary extra commission general recommend service even cheaper service simple mail many time better many year experience

1,UPS officially worst delivery company in the UK,"For years, Hermes (now Evri) were, in my opinion, the worst delivery company in the country. I would say that UPS have now usurped them. Here's why:I placed an online order with a company called Rugvista on 29th November. Delivery was supposed to be made within 1-5 working days.On Weds 4th Dec I received an email from UPS stating my item would be delivered by end of the day. However there seemed to some sort of delay at customs at Stanford Le Hope so the delivery did not happen. I received another email on Thurs 5th Dec stating the item was ""on it's way"" from Northampton. I live in Peterborough.I took a second day off work waiting for the parcel to arrive. The website did not show any updates and the item still has not arrived. By Friday 6th Dec, the UPS website still shows the item as ""on it's way"" from Northampton and had not updated since Thursday morning. Having already taken 3 days off from work at this point, I could not afford to miss a 4th waiting for the item to arrive and sign for it so I called UPS customer service on 0345 787 7877 (A little tip, when it comes to the spoken options say ""speak to someone"" and you will eventually get through to an actual person). That being said, the customer service person I spoke to was completely ineffectual and useless. After explaining to her the emails I had received and lack of tracking updates on the website after looking into it all she did was confirm to me the exact details I had given her.A scant explanation was given that ""this is the busy period"" hence the delays. But, in my opinion, all delivery companies should know this is the beginning of the busy period of the year and do whatever they can to minimise delays like this from happening.Also, apparently the emails are part of an automated system. She did offer me the option of going to the Northampton depot and collecting the item myself (so, instead of the DELIVERY COMPANY doing their job and delivering my item on time they give me the option of collecting it from them).The customer service person did take down my number and said they would contact the depot and have someone call me before end of business. Obviously that call didn't happen. I was also told just to keep checking the website for updates and if it hasn't updated over the weekend, to call them back so they can look into it again.Saturday morning I wake up and check the website to see it has finally updated and the item is ""out for delivery"" and should arrive between 2pm - 6pm. As it was 11am I thought I had plenty of time to head down to my local garage to pick up my motorcycle that had been in for repairs. Halfway through my journey I get an alert from the cctv camera at my house. UPS have arrived almost 3 hours early!!!So after days of delays on an item that needs to be signed for they give me a time window and then arrive early. Fortunately I had a friend staying over who was able to accept and sign for it.I will NEVER use UPS for anything. And if any company I order things from online use UPS I shall contact the company directly to arrange for a different delivery company to be used or go and find the item elsewhere from someone that does not use UPS. They are terrible at their job and their customer service is criminally bad.","Dec 8, 2024",year hermes evri opinion worst delivery company country would say ups usurped placed online order company called rugvista 29th november delivery supposed made within working wed 4th dec received email ups stating item would delivered end day however seemed sort delay custom stanford le hope delivery happen received another email thurs 5th dec stating item way northampton live took second day work waiting parcel arrive website show update item still arrived friday 6th dec ups website still show item way northampton updated since thursday morning already taken 3 day work point could afford miss 4th waiting item arrive sign called ups customer service 0345 787 7877 little tip come spoken option say speak someone eventually get actual person said customer service person spoke completely ineffectual useless explaining email received lack tracking update website looking confirm exact detail given scant explanation given busy period hence delay opinion delivery company know beginning busy period year whatever minimise delay like apparently email part automated system offer option going northampton depot collecting item instead delivery company job delivering item time give option collecting customer service person take number said would contact depot someone call end business obviously call happen also told keep checking website update updated weekend call back look morning wake check website see finally updated item delivery arrive 2pm 6pm 11am thought plenty time head local garage pick motorcycle repair halfway journey get alert cctv camera house ups arrived almost 3 hour early day delay item need signed give time window arrive early fortunately friend staying able accept sign never use ups anything company order thing online use ups shall contact company directly arrange different delivery company used go find item elsewhere someone use ups terrible job customer service criminally bad

I have had to call UPS four times in the last week, because one of the packages they apparently tried to deliver at 9pm at night when our office was closed (shocker!) And then put on the tracking that they refuse to deliver now because apparently my address of almost 20 years doesn't exist...Then another package a couple days later they didn't even attempt delivery, just marked it as a ""failure attempt"" because again, apparently they think my address is made up fictional place. Nope. It's a real place!Of course customer service was very little help, because when I finally got through and gave them the ""correct"" addresses that they apparently needed, they were the same ones that were already on the packages. So through this last 2 weeks I have had to call several times because one of them then ended up in Saskatoon.. (WTF) and the other one got delivered to a totally different business. A hardware store 5 km away (Again, WTF!)It's come to a point that if I know ahead of time that UPS will could be the courier for one of my deliveries, I find any way possible to not use them. I would urge anyone else to so the same. I would even choose Canada post everytime over UPS (Yeesh) and even with the current strike, we will probably still get my deliveries sooner than with UPS.At least then I also wouldn't have to call customer service weekly and waste my breath trying to convince them my address is real, not some fictious made up place that they keep refusing to deliver to.","Dec 6, 2024",ups absolute worst courier service planet delivery weekly sometimes even daily office depending driver many refuse deliver absolute dumbest reason could actually list 100 incidence last week already call ups four time last week one package apparently tried deliver 9pm night office closed shocker put tracking refuse deliver apparently address almost 20 year exist another package couple day later even attempt delivery marked failure attempt apparently think address made fictional place nope real place course customer service little help finally got gave correct address apparently needed one already package last 2 week call several time one ended saskatoon wtf one got delivered totally different business hardware store 5 km away wtf come point know ahead time ups could courier one delivery find way possible use would urge anyone else would even choose canada post everytime ups yeesh even current strike probably still get delivery sooner least also would call customer service weekly waste breath trying convince address real fictious made place keep refusing deliver

The only reason I'm leaving this review here and not on Yelp is that I don't want to penalize a physical location and its employees for the company's mistakes. 3 more bugs in 10 days have earned UPS this review:1) online seller had guaranteed room-of-choice delivery (heavy items). UPS just deposited them at the lobby. We had to lug them to our apartment.2) impossible to create an account: bugged at the address ZIP code (which I've been using for many years). Had to call 3 times, get disconnected, call back through a pretty long and complicated system to find help. In the end it did work but it took me approx. 1 hour to create a simple account (?!?!?!)3) my significant other bought an item through Best Buy and all of a sudden we receive an SMS notification that delivery will be made to the ""UPS Access Point"". We called UPS to confirm that the (heavy) parcel will be coming to our home and not some Access Point, they reassure us and on the day of delivery we receive a vague notification that the parcel is on its way as requested. Seemed fishy so I called UPS once again. After >1h on the phone with UPS we discovered that indeed our package was headed not towards our home but to that Access Point (which we had never selected), we cancelled, they rescheduled for our home but with 4 days delay.

Since then I have signed up for a UPS My Choice account, attempted to interact with that website and have spoken with two different customer service representatives. I am now enraged, frustrated and don’t understand how they are still a viable company.I have two packages coming via UPS. On the UPS tracking page for one item, I saw there were Change My Delivery options, which I wanted to access. A pop up said I needed to enroll in UPS My Choice to do so, so I did and then logged in. While LOGGED IN TO MY CHOICE, all attempts to view Change My Delivery options gave me a pop-up window saying I should enroll for My Choice. I tried again and again with the same result.I called customer service to try to figure out why their site didn’t work. After many irrelevant questions, I was finally told that my My Choice account and my package weren’t linked. Again, I enrolled in My Choice from the link ON THE ITEM TRACKING PAGE. After more frustration, wasted time and running in circles, I said I just wanted to delete my My Choice account because it was inoperable. I was transferred.The next representative asked for my item tracking number. I explained that I wasn’t calling about a package, but wanted to delete my My Choice account. She asked for my tracking number. I explained that I was told my item tracking number and my My Choice account weren’t linked, and I was calling about my My Choice account. She asked for my tracking number. I gave up and gave her the tracking number. She made me repeat it, she repeated it and then said that wasn’t a valid number. I read it again. She interrupted me so I had to start over. She repeated it. She said it wasn’t a valid number. She said I should contact the shipper for the correct number. I explained I was reading the UPS tracking number from the UPS item tracking page on the UPS website. She made me read the number again. We did this a few more times with the exact same number we’d been passing back and forth, but eventually it seemed to be a valid number. “What would you like to do with this package?” she asked me. I counted to ten. I explained the purpose of my call yet again. She asked my username, my email, my address and made me repeat each several times. She said I had the email address wrong. It couldn’t have been, but I finally gave her every email address I’ve ever owned. Eventually she seemed satisfied with one or all of those. She said the address was wrong. I gave her both addresses UPS had for me but she said both were wrong.My Choice is inaccessible, even when you’re logged in. I spent 40 minutes on the phone trying to cancel my My Choice account and was unable to do so because their extreme disorganization, lack of training and wild incompetence beat my intelligence and determination.

Tried 4 times, both on mobile and PC – get an error when I try to complete it with some numbercode and ”contact support. 3. Contact UPS support and say I get this error and I want it to pickup point, NOT to my home. 4. Next day, Tuesday. Says package will arrive to my home, within end of day, so I sit and wait at home. Wasting my time (as I didn’t want) – no package arrives. 5. Get an answer from UPS support, early thursday – they change it to pickup point, it will arrive there by the end of the day and I can pick it up tomorow (Friday). Great, problem solved. 6. No package arrives on Friday, no message. 7. Contact UPS support over weekend and say ”hey I never got my package on Friday as you said I would.. ” 8. Get answer on Monday that, package hasn’t been scanned since Thursday so something must be wrong and that I should ”file a claim”, respond back ”not scanned since Thursday, meaning what?

1,Subject Disappointing Delivery Experience,"Dear UPS Customer Service,I am writing to express my frustration with the poor delivery service I have experienced regarding my recent purchase from Emma Sleep.After placing my order with Emma Sleep, I was not given the option to select a delivery date, which isn't really your fault. Instead, I only became aware of the schedule through an email from UPS. I promptly requested delivery for Saturday, November 30th, but no delivery occurred on that date, nor did I receive any updates from UPS.Upon contacting UPS yesterday, I discovered there was missing information from Emma Sleep regarding my delivery, including full name, address, and phone number. This lapse in communication is unacceptable and has caused a significant delay.Additionally, I was informed there were two separate deliveries—one for a mattress and another for a pillow. Initially, only the pillow was out for delivery. After further discussion, I was assured both the mattress and pillow would arrive on December 3rd. Unfortunately, today's follow-up confirmed that only the pillow is scheduled, with no clarity on the mattress, adding to my frustration.This lack of coordination between UPS and Emma Sleep has resulted in a highly unsatisfactory experience. The shifting information and unfulfilled promises have been incredibly inconvenient.I request immediate clarification regarding the status of my mattress delivery and assurance of a timely resolution. I believe it is essential for UPS to improve its communication and coordination processes with partners to prevent such issues.Thank you for your attention to this matter.","Dec 3, 2024",dear ups customer service writing express frustration poor delivery service experienced regarding recent purchase emma placing order emma sleep given option select delivery date really fault instead became aware schedule email ups promptly requested delivery saturday november 30th delivery occurred date receive update contacting ups yesterday discovered missing information emma sleep regarding delivery including full name address phone number lapse communication unacceptable caused significant informed two separate mattress another pillow initially pillow delivery discussion assured mattress pillow would arrive december 3rd unfortunately today confirmed pillow scheduled clarity mattress adding lack coordination ups emma sleep resulted highly unsatisfactory experience shifting information unfulfilled promise incredibly request immediate clarification regarding status mattress delivery assurance timely resolution believe essential ups improve communication coordination process partner prevent attention matter

Despite providing all the necessary details and reaching out multiple times, I found the customer service process to be inefficient and unhelpful.The package was marked as “delivered” even though it was never received. When I contacted UPS, the response was dismissive, and they insisted that the package had been delivered without offering any concrete evidence or solution. I was asked to contact the sender, but UPS failed to acknowledge their responsibility as the shipping carrier.What made this worse was the lack of follow-up. After providing all the requested information, I was left in the dark with no updates or resolution. This level of customer service is unacceptable for a company that claims to be reliable.I would caution others to think twice before using UPS Canada for their shipping needs, especially for valuable or time-sensitive items.

Always with attempt times of 5-6PM so it's obvious the driver couldn't be bothered.- Stating delivery to the wrong places. Tracking saying they delivered our package to a random location in a different town/city and then washing their hands of the situation. The delivery address on the order is clearly totally different to the location their tracking states the package was delivered to, but nobody seems to care.- Package theft! Probably the most alarming one. High value packages going missing in UPS depots and the customer service reps admitting they have probably been stolen by sorting staff.

2,The shipper requires a signature,"The shipper requires a signature. If you aren't going to be home, UPS offers a path to waive the signature requirement. The problem is signing up for it, which requires yet ANOTHER username and password. I think the first seven or eight usernames I attempted were already taken. When I finally succeeded, UPS sends a verification code to my email address, but as I'm using my phone, I'm unable to get off the UPS page to access my email without losing the UPS page! Okay, finally get access, but the path to waiving the signature is very ambiguous. It says something like package released, not signature waived. If you want to change the delivery date, they charge you $10! Gee, thanks UPS. I have much better experiences with FedEx, but wasn't given a choice. BTW, UPS said the package would be delivered today, Wednesday, but now it's going to be Friday when I won't just ""not be home"", but out of town for several days.

1,bro trying to scam as much as possible,"When my package encountered customs clearance issues, I was not informed or given the option to self-clear the items as permitted under Canadian customs regulations. They only said my package lacked info and I did even give them my email for further contact or if I need to do sth. In fact, UPS did not contact me after that and, instead, proceeded with the clearance process on my behalf, which led to this significant and unexpected fee. $35 for the government charge (legitimate).$109 for UPS’s ""brokerage service fee"" (unjustifiable).(My family already paid $63 upfront for shipping this small package of personal items to me)I was fully capable of self-clearing, but UPS denied me this legal right by failing to notify me when the package required clearance. Instead, they justified their actions with a canned response that included assumptions like:""""UPS automatically handles the clearance for several reasons:•Most individuals don't have their own customs broker.•Many commercial customs brokers don't handle personal shipments.•Individuals often can't be reached at home during the day to provide clearance information.•UPS' automatic clearance for individuals speeds up the process for prompt delivery.The shipment has been consigned to UPS for customs clearance and the package was released on November 07, 2024. I am afraid that a request for Clears own is no longer possible for a High-Value/Dutiable shipment that has been released from customs.""""??? Is that the reason they can proceed with their extra service and now force me to pay for their insane fee, for what I did not want ?? I did not want UPS to act as my broker wth. Looks like I have come to the phase when I can do nothing but pay for their fee lol.Many individuals, including myself, are fully capable and willing to handle self-clearance if notified promptly. UPS’s assumption that individuals “may not be reachable during the day” does not excuse their failure to provide this option. The careful use of the phrase ""may not be"" implies that such situations are only possibilities, not certainties, and cannot justify denying customers the opportunity to self-clear.To illustrate, UPS did call me once to request some information related to my package and my address. However, at no point during that call did they mention anything about self-clearance. In fact, as instructed by their customer service representative, I even provided my email address to ensure I could be contacted if any further actions were required. Yet, I never received any follow-up emails from UPS. Why?This entire situation is utterly ridiculous. What UPS did and the reasons they provided are unacceptable. They deprived me of the opportunity to exercise my legal right to self-clear and instead imposed a service that I neither requested nor agreed to.Speeding up the process should not come at the expense of transparency and customer consent. Moreover, how can UPS assume I even needed the process to be expedited?To make matters worse, when I contacted UPS customer service multiple times, I received conflicting and misleading explanations. At different points, I was told I couldn’t self-clear because my package was a ""high-value shipment"" or my package was addressed to an individual,...What’s even more troubling is the broader implication of their practices. If I, as an informed individual, feel scammed, imagine how they exploit the elderly or busy customers who may not know their rights.UPS, stop hiding behind assumptions and deceptive policies. Transparency and customer consent should come first, not forcing unnecessary fees on unsuspecting customers. I will never recommend their service to anyone in my whole life, if I know anyone who intends to use their service, obviously I will try to convince them to use it from other places.","Nov 27, 2024",package encountered custom clearance issue informed given option item permitted canadian custom regulation said package lacked info even give email contact need sth fact ups contact instead proceeded clearance process behalf led significant unexpected fee 35 government charge legitimate 109 ups brokerage service fee unjustifiable family already paid 63 upfront shipping small package personal item fully capable ups denied legal right failing notify package required clearance instead justified action canned response included assumption like ups automatically handle clearance several reason individual custom commercial custom broker handle personal often ca reached home day provide clearance automatic clearance individual speed process prompt shipment consigned ups custom clearance package released november 07 afraid request clear longer possible shipment released reason proceed extra service force pay insane fee want want ups act broker wth look like come phase nothing pay fee individual including fully capable willing handle notified promptly ups assumption individual may reachable day excuse failure provide option careful use phrase may implies situation possibility certainty justify denying customer opportunity illustrate ups call request information related package address however point call mention anything fact instructed customer service representative even provided email address ensure could contacted action required yet never received email ups entire situation utterly ridiculous ups reason provided unacceptable deprived opportunity exercise legal right instead imposed service neither requested agreed process come expense transparency customer consent moreover ups assume even needed process expedited make matter worse contacted ups customer service multiple time received conflicting misleading explanation different point told package shipment package addressed individual even troubling broader implication practice informed individual feel scammed imagine exploit elderly busy customer may know stop hiding behind assumption deceptive policy transparency customer consent come first forcing unnecessary fee unsuspecting customer never recommend service anyone whole life know anyone intends use service obviously try convince use place

1,UPS Scanners measured a box outrageously WRONG. UPS Billing says their scanners NEVER make mistakes.,"We are a small shipper and spend roughly $1000/month with UPS. We shipped a CUSTOM BOX that we have manufactured specifically for us. The box measures 36x22x2 according to our manufacturer. We charge our customers for shipping at our actual cost from UPS, so the SIZE of the box is important to recoup our charges. Our past experience with UPS is such that we always enter the box size 1"" more than the size of the box so we don't always get hit by UPS for adjustments to the size that we can't subsequently pass on the the customer. In other words, when we ship a 36x22x2 box, we enter the size as 37x23x3. We shipped a 36x22x2 box weighing 4.2 lbs from Arizona to Louisiana. We entered the dimensions as 37x23x3. According to our UPS system, our cost was 27.78 -- which we charged our customer for shippingUPS ""lasers"" scanned the box as 41x 22x15 and charged an additional 76.62 as an ""adjustment"" on our bill. In other words, we charged our customer 27.78 to ship and UPS charged us 104.40 for the same box.We called to dispute this and questioned how a box that is 2"" high can be scanned as 15"" high.We received no response other than ""it is what it is""....our scanners don't make mistakes.""

1,I am loathe to write a negative review…,I am loathe to write a negative review as the driver that collects and delivers parcels to/from me is excellent. Unfortunately that is the point at which UPS customer service ends. Consequently I am going to have to find another carrier. Sent a parcel to Germany in September. Heard nothing until the recipient complained as his order hadn't arrived. No contact made from UPS to either myself as the sender or to the recipient. I had to go through their terrible website to try and speak to someone and work out what the issue was with the parcel. It transpired some information was missing. This was provided and acknowledged by UPS. They then proceeded to 'lose' the parcel and made me complete a trace form. I did this and requested that if it was located it still needed to be delivered to the consignee. The parcel was located. And then proceeded to be returned to me. By the time it arrived back in the UK there was a big hole in the side of the box and one item was missing from inside. I provided all the evidence I was asked for and since then have been sent round and round in circles and am none the wiser as to whether my claim for the missing item has been accepted. All I keep being given is nonsense about UPS terms and conditions and how important their customer care is to them. To add insult to injury I have now been sent an invoice for the return of the parcel that should have been safely delivered to the recipient in Germany. AND I had to pay to re-ship a new order. It is now mid November and I am still dealing with this single shipment. I have tried to remain loyal as I really like the local UPS driver but after this I am going to be using an alternative carrier.,"Nov 16, 2024",loathe write negative review driver collect delivers parcel excellent unfortunately point ups customer service end consequently going find another carrier sent parcel germany september heard nothing recipient complained order arrived contact made ups either sender recipient go terrible website try speak someone work issue parcel transpired information missing provided acknowledged ups proceeded parcel made complete trace form requested located still needed delivered consignee parcel located proceeded returned time arrived back uk big hole side box one item missing inside provided evidence asked since sent round round circle none wiser whether claim missing item accepted keep given nonsense ups term condition important customer care add insult injury sent invoice return parcel safely delivered recipient germany pay new order mid november still dealing single shipment tried remain loyal really like local ups driver going using alternative carrier

This was a blatant lie as the office still had the document and no one showed up to pick up. I waited a few days and still no pick up. I went online, but it stated that my pick up is complete and the charged the fee from my bank account. How can a big corporation like UPS have no integrity in services? I called the customer service and after a long hold, I was informed by the representative that “oh it was an error”. What an error? It is lies and fabricating information. This is unacceptable and I think people should think twice before using UPS. All the representative cared about was passing me on to a number where I could get refunded.

1,DO NOT USE UPS,"DO NOT USE UPS - UNPROFESSIONAL PEOPLE WITH NO RESPONSIBILITYTerrible. Got given notice that they would arrive on 8/11/2024 and they did not turn up. Then on 11/11/2024, while I was working, someone from UPS rang me on my mobile, while I was with a patient multiple times. I had to turn my phone off. I took one whole day off work on 12/11/2024. Took another day off work on 12/11/2024 and waited in my apartment the whole day, did now shower, did not eat, did not use the toilet as I did not want to miss out on the delivery. The man came, buzz at the gate and when I pressed the reply button, did not wait and left. I waited for a few minutes, in case he will ring again and he did not. I ran down to the foyer of the apartment and there was no delivery person. I missed my delivery. Rang the help line and was advised they will come in an hour and then received a phone call that they will not be coming and will come again tomorrow (13/11/2024). I told them that I work 6 days a week and cannot take another day off (as I have a mortage, bills to pay, was meant to go to the bank, had a car accident recently and did not get my car repaired as I was waiting for this delivery) and told the man that I cannot wait another day, for a delivery person who cannot buzz twice or wait a few minutes, the man's reply, ""that is your opinion"". I asked him ""what it that suppose to mean"" and he answered ""that is in some people's opinion"". Well guess what... it was recorded in the apartment camera, so I don't think it's my opinion. I asked if they could send it to a shop in Melbourne (my third phone call) -> a female shouted at me and told me that I will just need to wait until next Tuesday.

1,Worst Delivery Service Ever,"UPS is, without question, the worst delivery service I've ever dealt with. Every single time they’re involved, something goes wrong. My packages are either delivered to the wrong address, dumped at some distant pick-up point five blocks away (despite paying for home delivery), or worse, they just vanish. I’ve had multiple heavy parcels that I specifically ordered for home delivery because of their weight, only to find out they’re sitting at a pick-up spot far away. I then have to drag these oversized, heavy boxes home myself. It's infuriating.But this latest experience has taken it to a whole new level of incompetence. I ordered from an international website, completely unaware that they used UPS for delivery. Big mistake. A week has gone by, and I still haven’t received my order. When I checked the tracking, I found that UPS claims it was delivered two days ago to someone named ""HEMIN."" Who is ""HEMIN""? There’s no one by that name in my building, and I certainly didn’t authorize any ""HEMIN"" to receive my packages. I provided my full address and apartment number, so there is absolutely no excuse for this kind of mix-up.This service is beyond terrible. It’s unreliable, careless, and a complete disaster.

1,I am writing to express my deep…,"I am writing to express my deep disappointment and concern regarding my recent experience with the UPS Lawrenceburg location during the onboarding process. The lack of professionalism I encountered has left me feeling not only disregarded as a potential employee but also embarrassed and inconvenienced.I was instructed to come in for an orientation, which led me to make childcare arrangements and adjust my personal schedule accordingly. Upon my arrival, however, I was greeted in a way that made me feel unwelcome. No one introduced themselves, and I was left waiting in a room for what seemed to be an extended period of time without any communication or acknowledgment of my presence.Eventually, I was moved to another room where a staff member—whose name was never provided to me—struggled to log into the computer and appeared unprepared to proceed with the orientation. Despite the fact that my paperwork indicated I was hired, the disorganization and lack of communication were unprofessional and made me question the reliability of the hiring process at your facility.Moreover, after he took down my contact information, I was assured I would receive follow-up communication. However, I have yet to receive any contact from your office regarding next steps, further adding to my frustration and disappointment.As a candidate who was directed to attend orientation under the impression that my employment was secured, I feel this experience reflects poorly on the standards of UPS. The time I invested, as well as the personal accommodations I made, were disregarded.

1,Incompetent Liars,"Their drivers do not show up at your address and do not leave an InfoNotice number (because they never tried to deliver your package in the first place). I had to go back and forth with support over 8 times to understand where my package was, taking time out of my work day to navigate their severe incompetence. After 5 ""attempted deliveries"" not a single piece of proof was left that the driver had attempted the delivery. My building has a 24 hour security and concierge that accepts packages who also told me nobody arrived. What is mind blowing is that I had several other UPS orders delivered successfully during the same time period, it was a single package that somehow could not be delivered to the same address the rest were delivered to. Support lies and tells you that they are updating your case and will ensure the package arrives; it's a bunch of BS. They couldn't even explain why there was no InfoNotice left, they said they don't keep any record of whether the driver does leave one/what the number is. Again, SEVERE incompetence.I ordered a suitcase which was obviously time sensitive and it never arrived, it was on sale at the time of purchase and is no longer in stock.

1,Never trust UPS for any package that is…,"Never trust UPS for any package that is important to you.We happened to use a UPS store when we were in Glenburnie by chance. Our package got lost on the way by the UPS carrier. We tried calling the store but they never pick up the phone nor answer voice messages. After a long frustrating ordeal dealing with UPS customer service and its claim section, we were offered a 100 dollar reimbursement for the lost package whose value was way higher than it. Apparently that was the declared amount which I never did, and also apparently I agreed to all terms when I payed the shipping fees whose conditions I was never informed. I supposed to read a long document when there was a queue of customers waiting for their turn at the store.We refused the compensation, asked UPS to find the package and the reply we got was always "" ask the store to find it for you"".Then we had to go back to Glenburnie with hopes of getting help to find our package. When we got back to the store, we got no help from them. We were told to go to Laurel where the package was taken to from the store, but whose location even the store manager does not know! We had to find the location using google and taking the best guess. It was a big warehouse where the guards did not let us go inside or talk to any rep. Just a wild goose trip for which we had taken a leave of absence from work.Basically it was our mistake to trust UPS based on hearsay. UPS is here for business only, and it does not care to investigate if a package is lost through them. Just file the claims form is what you will hear from its reps. And they want you to be self aware about its insurance and lost packages policies which we were stupidly naive about.Long story short, if you cannot have your package lost, never use UPS because that is always a possibility and a big business like this will not care to find one lost package. You should have taken insurance is what the answer you will find out.","Oct 31, 2024",never trust ups package important happened use ups store glenburnie chance package got lost way ups carrier tried calling store never pick phone answer voice message long frustrating ordeal dealing ups customer service claim section offered 100 dollar reimbursement lost package whose value way higher apparently declared amount never also apparently agreed term payed shipping fee whose condition never informed supposed read long document queue customer waiting turn refused compensation asked ups find package reply got always ask store find go back glenburnie hope getting help find package got back store got help told go laurel package taken store whose location even store manager know find location using google taking best guess big warehouse guard let u go inside talk wild goose trip taken leave absence mistake trust ups based hearsay ups business care investigate package lost file claim form hear want self aware insurance lost package policy stupidly naive story short package lost never use ups always possibility big business like care find one lost package taken insurance answer find

We scheduled workloads so one of us could be here so we did not miss delivery.  It got to late afternoon and nothing had changed and so went onto online chat which gave same delivery info.  Asked to speak to human and they asked for our number and said they would call within 6 minutes - no call.  Went back onto chat and they then provided a customer service telephone number which I called.  Sunday in Customer Service offered an unapologetic service, she could not tell me where the packages were and just sent through a claim form which does not kick in until after 10 days.  She could not confirm whether the 5 large parcels had been lost or not and really wasn't concerned.  I have had one other negative experience from this organisation.

1,Extremely Disappointed with UPS Service,"Profound dissatisfaction with the service provided by UPS. My recent experience has been nothing short of horrendous. I had a package that was supposed to be shipped domestically, and yet it took an astonishing 20 days to arrive.This delay is completely unacceptable and speaks to the inefficiency and lack of organization within UPS. Throughout this period, there was a complete lack of communication and transparency about the whereabouts of my package.

1,87-year-old woman scolded by driver,"I arrived at my mother's home after work to find her extremely upset and visibly shaken.  She had a package (containing a few Q-tip boxes and assorted band aids) delivered by UPS.  She had stepped out onto her porch to greet the driver with a ""Hello and how are you today"" but was immediately scolded and degraded by the driver.  He informed her that he was not going to walk up her driveway every time she needed a package delivered and he was going to get the names and addresses of all the neighbors that had driveways similar to hers and when he had packages for them, he was going to take them across the street to the local propane company and leave them there.  He said it would be up to the propane company to notify the people that their package was left there and too bad if they didn't let you know.  He repeated himself several times and was extremely pissed off that he had to walk her package up the driveway.  My mother is 87 years old and certainly did not deserve to be treated that way.  She is now afraid to order anything again for fear of being in trouble.  It is beyond ridiculous that a driver representing a company that he works for would behave in such a manner.

1,Terrible Experience,"I am writing to express my disappointment with the service I have received from UPS over the past two months concerning two separate orders.First Order: There was an unjustified delay in delivery, as UPS claimed my address had missing information. After a three-day hold, I contacted UPS and verified that the address was complete and accurate. Yet, it took an additional three days for the delivery to be made, resulting in a total delay of one week.Second Order: Recently, I encountered the same issue again. This time, I was informed via email that I needed to pick up the order myself, which is confusing as I regularly receive orders from Amazon without such issues. Moreover, this particular order contained first aid supplies, and as someone who is unable to walk to pick up the package, the situation became even more stressful and problematic.This repeated problem has caused unnecessary delays and frustration, and it’s particularly concerning because UPS is the only service where I face this issue. I would appreciate it if UPS could investigate why this keeps happening with my orders and work to ensure that I don’t experience similar problems in the future.Please advise on how UPS plans to address this issue and improve the reliability of its service in my area.","Oct 24, 2024",writing express disappointment service received ups past two month concerning two separate order unjustified delay delivery ups claimed address missing information hold contacted ups verified address complete accurate yet took additional three day delivery made resulting total delay one order recently encountered issue time informed via email needed pick order confusing regularly receive order amazon without issue moreover particular order contained first aid supply someone unable walk pick package situation became even stressful repeated problem caused unnecessary delay frustration particularly concerning ups service face issue would appreciate ups could investigate keep happening order work ensure experience similar problem advise ups plan address issue improve reliability service area

1,Vandalism by UPS,"Today I received a valuable collector item delivered by UPS. The outside of the box was intentionally punctured several times (pictures attached). I am being targeted by Marsha the manager at Benwood, WV, and the driver because of a recent complaint I posted through the BBB a month ago.It is not possible that these types of violent puncture holes randomly happened in transit. Transit damage is usually the box is crushed or corners creased, but this was someone intentionally stabbing the box several times in a violent manner.As shown in the pictures this is clearly several stab like punctures that were inflicted on the box 9 times. The punctures went through the shipping box and into my collectors box. This will hurt the future value as a collectible. How else could such deep punctures happen if not intentionally?I am very, very concerned by the targeting and outright disregard that is being shown by UPS. Marsha of Benwood WV UPS mocked me and hung up on me twice in my previous dealings. She made a joke of the whole incident.The last incident a pair of shoes was missing, and the blame was put on the Shoe company. But this time? The manufacturing company did not stab this box 9 times before shipping it. There is no excuses this time and it is obvious that the driver is retaliating against me and this has to be stopped. This is the 2nd incident in a month and I am documenting this to protect myself against this outright assault and vandalism.My next steps are to contact my attorney and file a report with the local police for vandalism, targeting, and harassment. This is now is a Federal crime.I also attached the picture the UPS driver took of the delivery verification. It is quite odd he only took a blurry picture of the steps to my house. Why do this? It is because he intentionally damaged the box and did not want to show this in the picture.","Oct 24, 2024",today received valuable collector item delivered ups outside box intentionally punctured several time picture attached targeted marsha manager benwood wv driver recent complaint posted bbb month possible type violent puncture hole randomly happened transit transit damage usually box crushed corner creased someone intentionally stabbing box several time violent shown picture clearly several stab like puncture inflicted box 9 time puncture went shipping box collector box hurt future value collectible else could deep puncture happen intentionally concerned targeting outright disregard shown ups marsha benwood wv ups mocked hung twice previous dealing made joke whole last incident pair shoe missing blame put shoe company time manufacturing company stab box 9 time shipping excuse time obvious driver retaliating stopped 2nd incident month documenting protect outright assault next step contact attorney file report local police vandalism targeting harassment federal also attached picture ups driver took delivery verification quite odd took blurry picture step house intentionally damaged box want show picture

1,Useless Parcel Service,"On 20 September 2024 I ordered a new Emma mattress from John Lewis, as I was suffering neck pains because of my existing mattress. On 23 September 2024 John Lewis notified me that the item had been dispatched, that UPS were the couriers and that delivery would normally be made within two working days.I then heard nothing from UPS.On 2 October 2024 I contacted John Lewis to complain. On 2 or 3 October 2024 John Lewis informed me that the mattress would be delivered on 4 October 2024. Again, I heard nothing from UPS. I waited in for them, but they did not deliver the mattress on 4 October 2024, so I contacted John Lewis late that afternoon.On 7 October 2024 John Lewis informed me that Emma had confirmed that UPS had lost the item in transit. I replied that I would like a replacement mattress and asked them to expedite the order, though I also said that I would be away from 11 to 18 October inclusive. On 8 October 2024 John Lewis notified me that the replacement mattress had been dispatched and that delivery would normally be made within two working days. I replied that I was available any date from 21 October onwards.Once again, I heard nothing from UPS, so after I returned from my holiday, on the afternoon of Friday 18 October 2024, I contacted John Lewis to press for a firm delivery date. They came back to me and said they had been told that the mattress would be delivered either the same day or on Monday 21 October 2024. Yet again, I heard nothing from UPS. I waited in for them but the mattress was not delivered on 18 or 21 October 2024. John Lewis contacted me on 21 October 2024 to say that the mattress would not be delivered on that date. I said I was no longer available on 22 October 2024 but could do 23 October 2024. On 22 October 2024 John Lewis rang me to say that they had been told that the mattress would be delivered on 23 October 2024.I waited in for UPS on 23 October 2024. They delivered the mattress that day without contacting me in advance. The driver said it was the original mattress and that he had made several unsuccessful previous attempts to deliver it. This was the first time anyone had suggested this to me. No one had ever put a card through my door to say that they had tried to deliver the mattress.In summary, UPS repeatedly:1.	Delayed delivering the mattress.2.	Failed to contact me to arrange a convenient delivery date.3.	Failed to deliver the mattress on dates I had been given.The delay in replacing the previous mattress has caused me considerable pain, and UPS’s failures have wasted a great deal of my time and caused me to cancel unnecessarily activities I would have liked to do.A truly Useless Parcel Service.

1,Avoid this clown company,"Well, it looks like a LOT of people have beat me to the lowest rating possible. I'll be another. I applied for a seasonal delivery person. A week later I believe I received a message saying I was hired. That's awesome! It told me the pay and had me verify it was acceptable. It then kept giving me links for paperwork to fill out. I immediately got started but I couldn't unlock the W4 and I9. I used my mobile first, then used the desktop, then visited multiple places all to get the forms unlocked. I tried calling the number given to me for help but couldn't get through. I finally got it. I was told of the photos I needed to submit then would have them ready only to be told I needed more. My insurance one was rejected then resubmitted the exact same photo since I only had an electronic copy. Oddly, it went through the second time. Same for one of the photos for my car. I spent an excessive amount of time with them coming back and needing more. Finally, I get to the end and now I need someone who is standing with me to get this completed because they wanted a witness to verify my documents instead of taking them to HR like a real company does. All going smoothly....ish and I get to the end to watch an onboarding video and watch it through to the end. They want me to confirm that I watched it and then I get taken to a page that said this position is filled and to apply for something else. I'm completely confused because I had been told I was hired and had 10 days to complete the process. I wasn't going to wait that long so I started immediately. The hold up was THEIR site not working, having to resubmit the same info, and thinking I had everything done for them to basically reply ""kidding, we need this, too."" (X5) I have never had a more lengthy and frustrating process. Ever. If you need a job don't take these clowns, seriously. I would like to add that I called immediately after that really confusing last message about the position being filled. For starters, they didn't say first come first serve (not sure if that would have made a difference with their site not working) but the guy I finally reached said there were openings in 2 other cities: one out of state and the other a 3 hour round trip. I told him basically to get bent and I was leaving reviews everywhere. Don't waste people's time and resources who are looking for employment. I will never use their service again.

1,Completely Disappointed with UPS Service.,"I am absolutely furious with UPS and their handling of my recent shipment. Their incompetence has cost me time, money, and endless frustration. I shipped 8 packages from Alberta, Canada, to California, USA, and it has been a complete disaster from start to finish. Despite confirming the address multiple times, providing directions, and even suggesting alternative solutions, UPS kept giving me the runaround, with the status constantly bouncing between “More Information Needed” and “On the Way.”Now, I’m getting even more mixed messages. I received a text saying the shipping labels are missing and that they would send the packages back unless I paid for a new delivery attempt. Meanwhile, another agent is supposedly investigating and will contact me later. To make matters worse, they are now saying that the packages may be missing entirely.These shipments contained important information, including documents related to my university and professional designation, which I explicitly ensured were to be handled with care. The idea that these vital items could be lost because of UPS's incompetence is beyond infuriating.To claim that UPS is not responsible for the additional costs and inconvenience I’m facing is unacceptable. It’s absurd that a company of their supposed reputation would handle this so poorly and then dismiss their responsibility.This entire experience has left me deeply disappointed. The lack of accountability and customer care is shocking. I expected better from UPS, but this situation has completely shattered my trust in their service.

They tell you the package is coming days after it was estimated to be with you, but won’t let you amend the delivery instructions or add any driver instructions without signing up for an account and then verifying your address by having a letter sent to your house (how is that going to be of any use when a parcel is already on its way to you?!!) and then on the day tell you that the parcel requires a signature, by which time you can’t redirect it to one of their centres or change anything about the delivery via the tracking link or the pointless account you now have.

I could guess, I have to pay $126 on online if I want to my package. I called CS let them explain about $126. The associate said it's just what UPS do. I said I only paid with Canada Post $50 or less (can't clearly remember but I'm sure it was around $30) I kept asking why I have to pay $126 for $376 order? He passed me to their accounting department, the answer was same. Every company are different that only the guy could say. I said but why I have to pay $126?? so on.

Neighbor calls and informs us of this so I go to chat with an agent and ask what’s going on. Agent says neighbor delivery isn’t available for my package even tho it was approved the night before and basically tries to pin the blame on me and tells me I need to figure out another way to get the package. I set the package to be re-delivered at my home on the same day and cut my day short to be home for that. Hours pass with no update on my package and we wait and wait. My spouse goes outside to check just in case and finds a slip of paper under the wheel of the recycling bin saying they missed us and are taking the package to a facility. No one knocked on our door or attempted to contact us for the delivery.

1,DO NOT Trust UPS With Your Packages….,"I am beyond enraged at the way UPS handled my package. I am a freshman at the University of Oklahoma and my father shipped a large box I had made with items inside from my room. I could not fit the package in my sedan which was already packed with my other stuff so that’s why we shipped it. First off, the package took 2 weeks to arrive, and when it did, the package was nearly completely destroyed, with multiple large holes and tears on all sides where you could see the items inside easily. Numerous items were missing and many were damaged and shattered into pieces. My father has called UPS numerous times but no one answers and he is left on hold for a long time, and because he has to work he cannot stay on the phone for hours on end, which is ridiculous, so UPS’s customer service is non existent. The box was brought to the wrong address the first time which is why it took so long to get to me, and the person who shipped the package to that wrong address took a terrible photo that was pixelated and sideways where you could barely make out that there’s a box sitting up against a garage, and it looked as if the shipper was in a hurry and took the photo while driving, showing that this shipper does not drive safely and does not care about anyone’s packages. I have now lost a 2 TB Xbox hard drive that had ALL my games and progress on it, all my university documents, my AirPod Pros, and numerous items inside were damaged or destroyed and shattered into pieces as mentioned before. Just another instance of a large company getting away with wrongdoing and because they have so much money and are such a large company I imagine they could care less about me or my items, and they have made it as hard as possible to get your money back for the items lost. They force you to provide a value of the lost items, which is impossible for some of them because I do not know the value of my university documents that were lost, and they also want you to provide the EXACT name of the items word for word, and that is also nearly impossible to do for most of my items, so they will not give you compensation if you can’t do that, and it is set up that way on purpose so they get away with wrongdoing and won’t have to give you any money. Of course if you want to get ALL your money back you have to pay more, a perfect example of corporate greed at its finest. I will never see or receive those lost items again, or get compensation for them. Probably can’t get my money for the lost and damaged items since it’s been almost 2 months since I received the package and I am in a situation where some of the items lost have no known value or I cannot determine their value.

1,Both UPS and the UPS Store = Incompetance,"Both UPS and the UPS store have reached a whole new level of incompetence. Here is what happened:1. UPS originally redirected a package being sent to me for no reason.2. The person it was sent to in error was kind enough to contact UPS to have the package sent to me.3. UPS picked up the package and attempted to deliver it to my address which is a box at a UPS Store!4. The UPS Store refused the shipment from UPS because they say the label was illegible!5. UPS took the package back their warehouse.6. When I went to the UPS Store to pick up my package (as tracking said it was delivered), the UPS Store told me they refused it.7. I rechecked the tracking and it said the package was being returned to the sender and that is was now back in the city where they originally tried to deliver it to the wrong address.8. I called UPS and they said that they had caught the error and it was on the way back to my address at the UPS Store.9. I checked the tracking the next day and the package is now in another country on the way back to the original sender!10. I called UPS again and they said there is nothing they can do for me and that the original sender would have to redirect the package back to me. They also could not explain any of their errors including why I was lied to the day before by their customer service.This is such a level of incompetence for a company that is supposed to be transporting potentially expensive items (such as mine). The slogan says ""Trust..."" They must be kidding.Sadly nothing will improve and their incompetence will likely only get worse.If you care about something you are shipping, do not use UPS.

Why is my package being held hostage and I'm not allowed to go and pick it up at an office at the warehouse for example??

Also to notify me literally when the package is reaching the end of the window of delivery is the worst customer service!!

1,UPS Never on time unless it is to squeeze more $$$ from you,"Had a delivery that was set to go to a Penguin Pickup which is a chain of pick-up locations across the GTA that contracts with UPS.  Turned out that the location I always use has closed, the delivery time kept changing all day, finally get a call 5 hours past the delivery window saying that location is closed and to call UPS.  When I call I searched and there is another Penguin Pickup 200 meters away from that location, UPS wants to charge an extra $6.00 shipping to deliver there. I asked the customer service rep, would they not attempt a delivery again the following day and she confirmed yes, and I don't see how 200 meters on the opposite side of the street should cost $6.00 more to deliver.  Literally, the delivery time changed twice or they would have caught me during the time it was expected and I just would have met the driver.  I used the pickup location because they are always late and never on time. Nice to see them squeeze as much out of someone as they can when they cannot even be on time for deliveries.","Oct 12, 2024",delivery set go penguin pickup chain location across gta contract ups turned location always use closed delivery time kept changing day finally get call 5 hour past delivery window saying location closed call ups call searched another penguin pickup 200 meter away location ups want charge extra shipping deliver asked customer service rep would attempt delivery following day confirmed yes see 200 meter opposite side street cost deliver literally delivery time changed twice would caught time expected would met driver used pickup location always late never time nice see squeeze much someone even time delivery

1,"Honestly, the most delusional company firm, that i've ever used. Terrible system, terrible work-design and terrible customer service.","I have a parcel, that was stated to have a delievery at the ""end of the day"", and I noticed that the status at 11:44 changed to ""We are trying to retrieve information for the security/accesscode for the build, for our driver..."" (translated). Since the code is out of order, I decided to contact the customer service. I told them, since I am home, and they have my contact information including phone number and e-mail, that they would just call or text me, when they are here, so I can pick it up at the entrance. However, I was met with not only a rude lady, but also not very understanding one. She explained to me that their drivers don't have any phones, so contacting me is impossible. Having used a dozens of other delievery companies, from allover the world. I have yet to meet a company that dosn't allow their delievery guy to contact the receiver of the package. I couldn't help myself to ask ""what century is this?"", which wasn't very nice, but since we had a little rude chat going on already, I didn't really pay much into it. The lady put me on hold (gave me a time-out), then proceeded to say that their driver would now deliever the package to the nearest drop-off point, but 3 days later. Nearest drop-off point is litterally 20 meter away from where I live. I can even see it from my condo. I asked the lady, why I have to wait an additional 3 days to receive my package, when it's STILL stated to be delievered today, 20 meter from that point. Which she replied, that the driver has probably left the area.However she would try to contact the driver. Probably sending him a letter with a bird or something, since they don't have a phone, or any device that can be used to contact by text, phone or mail. To ask if he is still in the area. At this point, i'm asking her, how come the parcel is stated to be delievered at the end of the day, but the driver is already done in the area at 11:44? It even says on my status/tracking, that it can be as late as 19:00 before they show up, but she told me that ""end of the day"" means 10-17:00, which dosnt align with their own system. My parcel is still due for today, but will probably be moved 3 days later, because it's no longer at deliever by door, but at a drop-off point, 20 meter away from my home. The lady was exceptionally rude for one working at customer service, and had no understanding or will to explain how their system is flawed and dosn't paint a clear picture.","Oct 4, 2024",parcel stated delievery end day noticed status changed trying retrieve information build driver translated since code order decided contact customer service told since home contact information including phone number would call text pick entrance however met rude lady also understanding one explained driver phone contacting impossible used dozen delievery company allover world yet meet company do allow delievery guy contact receiver package could help ask century nice since little rude chat going already really pay much lady put hold gave proceeded say driver would deliever package nearest point 3 day later nearest point litterally 20 meter away live even see condo asked lady wait additional 3 day receive package still stated delievered today 20 meter point replied driver probably left would try contact driver probably sending letter bird something since phone device used contact text phone mail ask still area point asking come parcel stated delievered end day driver already done area even say late show told end day mean dosnt align system parcel still due today probably moved 3 day later longer deliever door point 20 meter away home lady exceptionally rude one working customer service understanding explain system flawed do paint clear picture

They provided a phone number a email and parcel number. I already was familiar with that email. I was using it in the past to send information without response. That lead to the small dispute I mentioned earlier. I tried calling that number several times but it was invalid. The actual UPS support could not find the package number in their system. It was at that state for days. And I unable to solve it while still trying and preparing to loose over 300$ and goods in almost the same value.

Ups showed up in our driveway and once I noticed them I was to the gate trying to give this man the box and he pulls out and leaves. I didn't know what to do, as it's not mine. But what's pretty stupid is not only should they have let him know they were coming because it said the return had only been initiated and would update when they were coming, I go to look in the mailbox for the label because I am now gonna have to take it to a ups dropoff location because they can't do a simple job, and theres not anything in there so I'm like what the heck? I go to walk back inside and the label with a note that's literally made to hang on a fence/door knob, is just laying in the ground not even together like the wind blew it around. And I know he didn't even try to hang it up because you had to rip a piece apart to do that and it wasn't ripped until I just done it because I didn't understand why he didn't do that instead of just throwing it in the ground.

They were no help in locating it and gave us the runaround for a full day while she missed work and we scrambled to figure out how to get her kids to and from school. UPS agreed to a refund but said I had to drive back to the store where I sent it and submit it through them. I was told it would be a full refund, but that UPS would mail me a check in the next 7-10 days rather than refunding my original payment method. The check comes two weeks later and is only a partial refund saying it's for ""shipping fees only."" The only reason I paid for them to ship it was because it was guaranteed on Monday morning! I would have driven it back otherwise. UPS made over 9 billion in PROFIT (net was 91 billion) in 2023.

1,Dishonest and Crazy employees,"This is the most lying, dishonest, corrupt company that exists. I've had many negative experiences with UPS mishandling packages and leaving them on the sidewalk, but this one takes the cake. Their offshore customer service and local facility staff are equally horrible. The issue is clearly with the executive team and their software control over their employees, as well as not letting anyone provide good customer service. I had two packages in the same shipment worth $4000 in products. The driver brought one package to my building and asked me to sign for it (both of them); it was a signature required. I told him I would not sign for one when two were in the delivery. He says he will look for the other after I sign it or deliver it tomorrow. I told him I would sign for both of them both of them. He demands I sign for it, or he threatens to mark it as refused. When I said I was not refusing it, he took my package and ran away with it, shouting, ""I'm keeping it"" like a three year old child. I, of course, called UPS and got their offshore customer service. After being on the phone for two hours, I was promised a 10 am delivery, and that the driver would never deliver here again, and they were talking to the local center according to them. Well, anything they promise is an absolute lie. It turns out the local people don't care what UPS tells me. They say, ""They should not do that,"" but they do, and they refuse to honor it. So it was after 10 am, no package and the same driver was coming to my house. That wasn't very pleasant to me. This is how UPS treats people because I'm not paying their bills directly, so they will cheat and screw everyone over because they don't care about their monopoly. I wish I had just called the police and filed a police report on them instead of calling customer service. It would have been far more productive, and this is the Chicago Police we are talking about, as they wouldn't do anything. For other reasons, I stopped using UPS to ship from my business, but this cements I would never. I ship USPS daily, and my loss rate is 1 out of 500 or $42 product loss on 21k of revenue.

So unnecessarily, I have to wait a day to MAYBE be able to pick it up, if that is even possible now…. It’s a shame it has come to this as I used to really like my UPS in my town.

1,UPS Insurance is a Complete Sham,"UPS Insurance is a Complete ShamJune 17 2024 I shipped $7500 of electronic gear from Nashville to Colorado Springs. The coverage was too high, so I settled for $3500, which still cost about $90. I got a brand new Lowes box rated for 80 lbs. The package weight was 74 lbs. I packed the items tightly using peanuts, bubble wrap, and foam. When it was delivered, it was taped up everywhere because it had split wide open; the driver said it was one of the worst jobs of mishandling he’d ever seen. Most of the packing materials were missing. One of the items, worth over $3500, was destroyed so I made a claim for the $3500 coverage (claim number 000-04-553269 - UPS Capital Insurance Agency, Inc 0C47342). I sent as many pictures as the site would allow. It was denied with this disclaimer: “Unfortunately, after a thorough investigation, we are unable to approve the claim because the packaging did not meet UPS standards according to the UPS Tariff/Terms and Conditions.” I appealed and was turned down again with “it does not conform to our guidelines”. So I read their guidelines, and this package checked off every single point. When I explained that they again denied it with “what you have purchased is coverage under the UPS Declared Value program. This is unlike an insurance as you do not have a binding insurance policy.” What???? No further explanation. Being a UPS customer for over 40 years evidently means nothing. Nor does honesty.","Sep 17, 2024",ups insurance complete shamjune 17 2024 shipped 7500 electronic gear nashville colorado spring coverage high settled 3500 still cost 90 got brand new lowes box rated 80 lb package weight 74 lb packed item tightly using peanut bubble wrap foam delivered taped everywhere split wide open driver said one worst job mishandling ever seen packing material missing one item worth 3500 destroyed made claim 3500 coverage claim number ups capital insurance agency inc 0c47342 sent many picture site would allow denied disclaimer unfortunately thorough investigation unable approve claim packaging meet ups standard according ups appealed turned conform guideline read guideline package checked every single point explained denied purchased coverage ups declared value program unlike insurance binding insurance explanation ups customer 40 year evidently mean nothing honesty
1,UPS is BAD,"Where other delivery services like DHL make it easy to change the delivery date of a package, UPS makes you sign up for, like, two services, and then the buggy system still doesn't work.

1,UPS has three levels of service and they all are horrible,"UPS has three levels of service, AI phone, website, and human phone.  The AI phone system is the worst and I truly believe it was designed to frustrate customers more than to help them.  It is the worst system I have ever experienced.  Ask it to help you place a hold on a package, and it rambles off tracking information unrelated to your request or it will just hang up on you.  It simply is garbage.  Talking to a human if you can actually get one on the phone, is also useless.  You will hear 99% of the time....""My system will not let me.....'enter your problem here' and none of them are based in the US.The website, well, is also garbage.  Makes you sign up for UPS choice to manage your package and then tells you UPS choice does not work with commercial packages.  Why in the world would it tell you to sign up for something if it already knew it would not work with the tracking number (?).  Simply a waste of time and overall bad coding.  Try to sign up for the business equivalent of UPS choice and you get a bunch of website errors and your monitor displays of bunch of random HTML code.  The entire system is garbage, just like the company.  The only good thing I have found about UPS is if you can actually speak with a local location to an actual human in the US. You will find these people will bend over backwards to help you.  It is the only shining point about UPS.  Though good luck trying to navigate the treacherous waters of UPS customer service to actually talk to one of them.

1,Insultingly bad service,"I listed every detail of my address perfectly, gave directions on how to find my front door, since I live in a townhome, and even offered to provide pictures for the driver. The driver apparently attempted to deliver my package but ""could not because there was no apartment number"" I do not live in an apartment... I was then left fighting with the website to try to find the package I ordered. Eventually I called the company, to be greeted by an AI customer service rep.

1,Unacceptable Experience with UPS Alcohol Delivery nted with my…,"I am extremely disappointed with my recent experience with UPS, specifically regarding a package containing alcohol. When the driver arrived, I provided my payroll signature, which I have consistently used when making any alcohol purchases. However, the driver immediately deleted my signature, stating that it was not legible enough because the package contained alcohol. I explained that this was the signature I use for all my alcohol purchases, and that my legal age is determined through my ID, not by the appearance of my signature. Despite this, the driver never once asked to verify my ID to confirm my age.Upon contacting UPS customer service to address the issue, I was told that my signature needed to match the one on my ID. This explanation is not only illogical but also raises serious concerns about UPS’s delivery practices. By this flawed logic, anyone could easily sign for alcohol, including a minor, as long as the signature is deemed “legible.” I questioned how UPS ensures they are not delivering alcohol to underage individuals if they are solely relying on signature legibility instead of proper age verification through ID checks.During my call with customer service, I was assured that someone from my local UPS store would contact me to inform me when the package would be redelivered. Instead, I received the following response:**“GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR REACHING OUT. WE HAVE RECEIVED YOUR CASE INFORMATION AND CONTACTED THE DRIVER REGARDING THIS REFUSED PACKAGE. AFTER TALKING WITH THE DRIVER, WE WERE INFORMED THAT THE PACKAGE WAS ALCOHOL AND YOUR CHOICE OF SIGNATURE WAS NOT VALID FOR THE DRIVER TO RELEASE THE PACKAGE. THIS PACKAGE WILL BE RETURNED TO THE SHIPPER AND YOU MUST CONTACT THEM TO ARRANGE NEW DELIVERY OR REFUND FOR ITEMS. WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE AND WE HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY.”**Not only did the response incorrectly state that I refused the package (which was entirely inaccurate), but it also failed to address the core issue: the driver’s refusal to accept my valid signature without checking my ID. This experience has been frustrating, and the mishandling of my package has been incredibly inconvenient. UPS’s policy and execution are inconsistent, and this incident reflects poorly on their commitment to secure and proper alcohol delivery.I will be sharing my experience across multiple social media platforms to inform others of the poor service and unprofessional behavior exhibited by UPS and their driver. This situation has demonstrated a clear lack of proper training and communication, and I hope that UPS takes immediate action to address these shortcomings to prevent similar issues for other customers in the future.","Sep 7, 2024",extremely disappointed recent experience ups specifically regarding package containing alcohol driver arrived provided payroll signature consistently used making alcohol purchase however driver immediately deleted signature stating legible enough package contained alcohol explained signature use alcohol purchase legal age determined id appearance signature despite driver never asked verify id confirm contacting ups customer service address issue told signature needed match one id explanation illogical also raise serious concern ups delivery practice flawed logic anyone could easily sign alcohol including minor long signature deemed questioned ups ensures delivering alcohol underage individual solely relying signature legibility instead proper age verification id call customer service assured someone local ups store would contact inform package would redelivered instead received following response good afternoon thank reaching received case information contacted driver regarding refused package talking driver informed package alcohol choice signature valid driver release package package returned shipper must contact arrange new delivery refund item apologize inconvenience hope great response incorrectly state refused package entirely inaccurate also failed address core issue driver refusal accept valid signature without checking id experience frustrating mishandling package incredibly inconvenient ups policy execution inconsistent incident reflects poorly commitment secure proper alcohol sharing experience across multiple social medium platform inform others poor service unprofessional behavior exhibited ups driver situation demonstrated clear lack proper training communication hope ups take immediate action address shortcoming prevent similar issue customer future

I can't get through to a real person because the system is set up to hang up on you and verbally refuses to let you talk a representative, while pretending it's hard of hearing even if you YELL the tracking number. I paid $20 for their premium address change service only to be told my mailing address is a business, so no (you're right, they sell mail services! Not my real address. This is true for a lot of people in Alaska.). The shipper is having to refund me because of UPS incompetence. And UPS refuses to give me my $20 back. I tried to get a supervisor on the phone, but they just transferred me to another agent that was playing pretend supervisor. Now I'm on hold with billing. Billing doesn't know why they transferred me. I don't really know, either. I'm pretty sure I just got punked by this so called supervisor. They definitely like to leave you on hold for an hour with no refreshes like phone agents are supposed to do. So, the conclusion: I'm not getting a refund. Since their system is working just fine on their end (their assumption), they don't care if it's messing up on the shipper or customer's end. They see no reason to report a bug in the system at all. Everything is fine for them, so everything should be fine for you. Goodbye. This literally took me an entire day.UPS is definitely not a good shipper if you live in Alaska. Use Fedex or USPS. Fedex actually developed an entirely new system of procedures, services, and pricing just for Alaska. They adapted to us. USPS adapted their system to us a long time ago.

1,UPS refuses to deliver my international…,"UPS refuses to deliver my international package. They keep it in Warehouse without reason. Shipped 08.13. $900 with delivery date of 08.19.??? B.S. 08.29 and no updates / movementWhile the staff at the Parrish UPS store is friendly and accommodating, the overall performance of UPS as an international logistics company absolutely beyond poor.Instead of telling a customer at time of accepting & preparing items (in my case 15lbs bag of clothing - luggage, for which I gave employee a detailed, each line item pack list) for shipping, what documents and info are needed, you pay a huge amount (close to $900 for 15 lbs to Germany) for Express Shipping (was told only option) only to learn that your shipment is being held up indefinitely by UPS brokers/Customs overseas due to missing documents and information, you were never told you needed ? First, US based Phone Number not accepted? Need to provide Destination country Number,  need copy of Passport & Flight Itinerary (while it may make sense), it causes unnecessary and frustrating delays, because of UPS failure to communicate rules properly, effectively. Initially  I was repeatedly told ""no problem with shipment"". Only, after sending email in German, to some UPS international email in Germany, did I slowly get responses and was informed of missing documents for processing/release.I thought shipping luggage ahead of time would ease stress at airport? For that amount of money, I could have shopped for clothes over there and spared myself a lot of time & aggravating back and forth emails, calls. I guess dealing with airline luggage issues is maybe still a better option?Note: Local employees consult with and follow instructions of UPS international shipping group, who is squarely to blame for all delays and mishaps, while customer is at local store. There is a lot of room for improvement to say the least. Not a reliable carrier & definitely NOT EFFICIENT. UPS international is not doing local UPS Store owners any favors by upsetting and alienating customers. Whether shipment ever reaches its final delivery destination remains to be seen? Package was given to UPS store/sent on 08.13.24 and orig. delivery date given by local UPS, was 08.19.24. Per UPS track number extensive import / warehouse scan history, package arrived in Germany in UPS warehouse in Ķöln on 08.15.24. On 08.16. Was told German phone number was needed (given US number insufficient), which was immediately provided. No mention ever of missing passport or flight itinerary? I repeatedly asked verbally and in emails (in English and German) whether there is a specific issue/reason that is holding up delivery.  Nothing ref. missing documents was ever said/relayed until 08.25.24? All required/requested info was instantly provided. The handling of this shipment/matter by UPS is simply inexcusable, unprofessional.

I feel I should have been told this upon checkout with my item, or even once it hit Calgary, not Edmonton. So I called them to correct this with an address change. This is where is gets frustrating. I gave this lady my legal address several times. She even repeated it back to me. I told her I was concerned it will not be delivered to my home because I live in the COUNTRY, not a town or city. I asked for the parcel to be dropped off in Athabasca, at the Ups access point. She faught with me and said there wasn't one there, but the parcel will show up at my house. The change in address would take up to 3 bussiness days. I also had to pay another fee to have this address changed. I was doing everything in my ginger power to refrain from loosing my cool on the phone. 3 days pass and I see on their website, my address is wrong!!!!! Like how the h*** do you mess this up, considering we went over it how many times on the phone. So I call back to correct it again. This parcel is should have been delivered on August 13th. When I spoke to this other gentlemen, I explain the situation, and asked again for it to be delivered to the Ups access point in Athabasca. I honestly felt it would not be delivered to the country side. He assured me it would. I asked to speak to a supervisor, who could speak fluent English, and he would not transfer me over. He told me if I wanted to make another address change I would be charged for that again. Once again these changes would take up to 3 bussiness days. From here my temper escalated and I told him, I'm positive my parcel will not be delivered to my home in the country. Can we please just do the access point in Athabasca for it. He again replied this would be another charge for the change, but nothing is in his system for Athabasca. I was so frustrated with him. I said, so what happens when this parcel doesn't show up? He said to call them back. I have been watching their web page for well over a week now, with no change in delivery status. So, I changed the delivery address to - guess where?!?!?! The access point for ups in Athabasca, which they both told le doesn't exist. I know damn well this access point exists because I have had to use it for bussiness purposes. We are now on August 23, and still no change in the delivery date, no parcel in hand, and all I have noticed is how incompetent these employees truly are. I have paid more fees for this package than I ever should have. How the hell do they stay running??? My change in address to the nearest Ups access point is stuck in a ""pending"" status. This parcel is somewhere between Edmonton and Athabasca. I even told these guys to tell their drivers to just drop the damn package off in edmonton and I'll get it when I'm there next. But no, they can't do that they said. Yet on their website, it clearly states that when I changed the delivery address to the ups access point, it would notify the driver right away on their handheld computer. So don't tell me again, you can communicate with you're ups drivers when it comes to the parcels they are transporting!!! I just want my damn package 📦. I'll never use, or recommend this transportation company again.","Aug 23, 2024",parcel came way uk passed calgary edmonton edmonton get notification delivered po box feel told upon checkout item even hit calgary edmonton called correct address change get frustrating gave lady legal address several time even repeated back told concerned delivered home live country town city asked parcel dropped athabasca ups access point faught said one parcel show house change address would take 3 bussiness day also pay another fee address changed everything ginger power refrain loosing cool phone 3 day pas see website address wrong like h mess considering went many time phone call back correct parcel delivered august 13th spoke gentleman explain situation asked delivered ups access point athabasca honestly felt would delivered country side assured would asked speak supervisor could speak fluent english would transfer told wanted make another address change would charged change would take 3 bussiness day temper escalated told positive parcel delivered home country please access point athabasca replied would another charge change nothing system athabasca frustrated said happens parcel show said call back watching web page well week change delivery status changed delivery address guess access point ups athabasca told le exist know damn well access point exists use bussiness purpose august 23 still change delivery date parcel hand noticed incompetent employee truly paid fee package ever hell stay running change address nearest ups access point stuck pending status parcel somewhere edmonton athabasca even told guy tell driver drop damn package edmonton get next ca said yet website clearly state changed delivery address ups access point would notify driver right away handheld computer tell communicate ups driver come parcel transporting want damn package never use recommend transportation company
1,Final straw for me using ups,"Most companies I purchase from don’t use UPS. But on the few times that UPS do deliver to me it’s always the same.yesterday I get a 4 hour window ( 9.30-1.30). By 2pm this then changed to end of the day ( which looks to be 7pm).  By 11pm this is amended to delivery details will follow. Today we are following the same path and from previous experience I don’t expect the delivery to come. That will be 2 full days hanging around for them. Don’t want to leave in a safe space as it a big expensive parcel. There is no way to track like there is with their competitors who are far better. To complain I have to register an account read a massive list of terms and conditions that waivers their liability in their duty to their customers, which doesn’t bode well for how they will deal with my complaint. I will be canceling my order with the supplier and use another company that does not deliver through UPS as this is the same every time with this Mickey Mouse company !!! without fail.","Aug 23, 2024",company purchase use ups time ups deliver always get 4 hour window 2pm changed end day look 7pm 11pm amended delivery detail follow today following path previous experience expect delivery come 2 full day hanging around want leave safe space big expensive parcel way track like competitor far better complain register account read massive list term condition waiver liability duty customer bode well deal complaint canceling order supplier use another company deliver ups every time mickey mouse company without fail

5,This review is for drivers not the CEO,"This review is for drivers not the CEO. If I would have to grade the company admins, it'd be an F-.It's the drivers and managers at the warehouse facilities who make this company. I had a few issues with my delivery due to a signature requirement. Called my local UPS store, to ask if I can pick up my package there. Apparently UPS stores are 3rd party business and not part of UPS (huh? um ok).Then the real nightmare started. Wow is that AI system horrible. If UPS and their terrible CEO want to destroy their company and reputation, have at it, but if you want to keep and build your customer base, maybe get rid of that horrible, condescending and incapable AI customer service. I was not upset about my package at all, but wow, your AI machine really cracked open my annoyance for the day. Newsflash, people want to talk to real people, not machines. I get it if you have an easy to answer question that should be rerouted, but if your question is complex, good luck. That machine doesn't even understand the 10 mile long UPS number, and if you get really lucky, it just hangs up on you.When you finally break through this wall, you get connected with very friendly, but very far away (from USA grounds) customer service representatives. To fix your issue, the very friendly, but very far away people then have to call the warehouse in the US, to understand what the issue was and to find a remedy. Efficiency? Nope, saving money. It's disgusting how outsourcing is just blatant money saving, devaluing the people who have to listen to annoyed customers all day. I hope one day you get the compensation you deserve.The far away representatives promised someone would call me within an hour. That did not happen. Called again (another 10 min to break through the wall of the Stepford wives), was promised another call within an hour. That also didn't happen, but it was already past 7 PM, so I didn't expect anything to happen. The very far away representatives are probably dealing with a time change that makes it hard to address things in the US, so I don't blame them.Got the call from the warehouse manager. Very friendly and helpful. He offered a few options, one of which was to check with the local UPS store if they'd take the package so I could pick it up. Nope they won't (cause remember, 3rd party service). The awesome drive then checked with my apartment manager who was so kind to sign it on my behalf.Just wanted to leave an A+++ for the awesome customer service of the real people I talked to and the drivers and managers who probably work their asses off to keep this company rolling.Reading Reddit UPS posts really opened my eyes. Everyone's being outsourced to save a few bucks, so that the CEO can claim she's made this company profitable for the investors. For how long? I smell another Stockmarket crash, because really, how long can you keep cutting positions? It is mind boggling. Profit over people will only last you for so long. We're social animals, and we don't want to talk to machines. People who are valued work harder, just an fyi to the incredible incapable CEO and her army of terrible decision makers.","Aug 14, 2024",review driver ceo would grade company admins driver manager warehouse facility make company issue delivery due signature requirement called local ups store ask pick package apparently ups store 3rd party business part ups huh um ok real nightmare started wow ai system horrible ups terrible ceo want destroy company reputation want keep build customer base maybe get rid horrible condescending incapable ai customer service upset package wow ai machine really cracked open annoyance day newsflash people want talk real people machine get easy answer question rerouted question complex good luck machine even understand 10 mile long ups number get really lucky hang finally break wall get connected friendly far away usa ground customer service representative fix issue friendly far away people call warehouse u understand issue find remedy efficiency nope saving money disgusting outsourcing blatant money saving devaluing people listen annoyed customer day hope one day get compensation far away representative promised someone would call within hour happen called another 10 min break wall stepford wife promised another call within hour also happen already past 7 pm expect anything happen far away representative probably dealing time change make hard address thing u blame call warehouse manager friendly helpful offered option one check local ups store take package could pick nope wo cause remember 3rd party service awesome drive checked apartment manager kind sign wanted leave awesome customer service real people talked driver manager probably work ass keep company reddit ups post really opened eye everyone outsourced save buck ceo claim made company profitable investor long smell another stockmarket crash really long keep cutting position mind boggling profit people last long social animal want talk machine people valued work harder fyi incredible incapable ceo army terrible decision maker

1,"UPS is horrendous, especially Saturday delivery drivers!","I tried to get a car seat delivered through UPS. This was a present from my babyshower. We live in an appartment complex with a mail room which can be accessed Monday through Friday by delivery drivers. Saturday the building is closed to the public. The car seat was delivered on a Saturday. We were out of town and I had a big sign on my door that they please should not drop off packages outside my door since we are out of town. The normal thing to do would have been to deliver the car seat on Monday to the mail room since obviously nobody was home. What did UPS do? They dropped off the almost 600 dollar car seat outside of my door. What was the result? It got stolen, pending police investigation. We complained and the company delivered another car seat through UPS. This time we were at home. The delivery was also on a Saturday. We were able to follow the delivery driver on a map. The scheduled delivery was between 10:15am and 12:15pm. This time frame got more and more delayed. In the end the car seat was supposed to be delivered &quot;before 7pm that day&quot;. We stayed home all day since the first car seat was stolen and we did not want to risk that anything happens to the package again. Around 5pm the driver was finally in our area. My husband went outside to look for the truck. A minute later I got the notification online that the delivery was attempted, but nobody was home and that they would try again on Monday. The map to follow the truck was also not available any more. After waiting all day for this delivery, we got nothing. We tried calling UPS, but they just said that the driver has off now and they would try again on the following Monday. We explained that I am pregnant and that I cannot lift the car seat package of 20 pounds and bring it from the mail room to my appartment and that my husband is working until late. We were asking them to please deliver the package to our door on Monday since it got stolen before and even the mail room was not a safe place. UPS did not deliver to our door, even after all the hassle. On top of that the package was damaged on 2 sides and now the car seat has a few scratches. This one delivery resulted in weeks full of hassle, extra time spent on our end (police report, calls to the car seat company, calls to UPS etc), all things that could have been avoided by UPS.","Aug 13, 2024",tried get car seat delivered ups present babyshower live appartment complex mail room accessed monday friday delivery driver saturday building closed public car seat delivered saturday town big sign door please drop package outside door since town normal thing would deliver car seat monday mail room since obviously nobody home ups dropped almost 600 dollar car seat outside door result got stolen pending police investigation complained company delivered another car seat ups time home delivery also saturday able follow delivery driver map scheduled delivery time frame got delayed end car seat supposed delivered quot 7pm day quot stayed home day since first car seat stolen want risk anything happens package around 5pm driver finally area husband went outside look truck minute later got notification online delivery attempted nobody home would try monday map follow truck also available waiting day delivery got nothing tried calling ups said driver would try following monday explained pregnant lift car seat package 20 pound bring mail room appartment husband working late asking please deliver package door monday since got stolen even mail room safe place ups deliver door even hassle top package damaged 2 side car seat scratch one delivery resulted week full hassle extra time spent end police report call car seat company call ups etc thing could avoided ups

1,"UPS Store #2788, Virginia Beach, Va","UPS Store #2788, 1340 N Great Neck Rd Suite 1272, Virginia Beach, VaThis review is also going to UPS Corporate.Today, July 6, at 12:23 PM I brought in an Amazon return package that was required to be sent via an official UPS store. Although I’ve read many negative reviews, I’ve had good service from this location for many years, but what happened today was so disgusting that my rating has gone, in one trip, from a 5 star to a 1 star.I’m 75 years old and was struggling to unload from my truck bed and carry this very large box (containing a collapsible wheel chair) weighing approximately 50 lb. When I got to the store’s double door entry which only opens to the outside, I could not hold the box and open the door at the same time, so I propped the box up against the left side door, the one that’s usually, for many businesses, not even unlocked. I held it there with one hand and my knee. I opened the right side door, re-established my grip on the box, and entered the store. If I had placed the box on the ground to open the door, I would’ve had a very difficult time lifting it up again. There was no one around that I could’ve asked to open the door for me. There was no one exiting the store.The worker and I were the only 2 people in the store. I greeted the man with “Hi, how you doing today?” His response was “I would be doing OK if you’d not tried to break my door!” To which I respectfully responded “I was having a problem getting my box in. I always wonder why stores like this don’t have doors that swing both ways.” I don’t recall his exact words, but after he threw my receipt at me, he rudely left the conversation by walking into the back room, and said on the way something about me “not having the intelligence to correctly open the door.” After he insulted me, I then stated “Now I see why this store has so many negative reviews” to which he responded from the back room. Don’t remember exact words, but they included “Get Out!”FYI, there was absolutely no abuse, much less damage, to the left side door or its mechanism. When I propped the box, there was a minor noise when the door set firmly against its latching /locking mechanism.I have ID’ed the time of drop off in case anyone associated with this store wants to know who this extremely rude employee or owner was. As far as I could see he was the only worker there at this time. He was a little on the short side, just slightly heavy, with a small black beard/ goatee. I suspect, from reading other reviews, that he could have been Joe.This store is only about 5 minutes from my home, much closer than the others in town. So, I intend to go there again when I need to, which thankfully, is not very often. One more episode like this and they will never see me again.","Aug 12, 2024",ups store 2788 1340 n great neck rd suite 1272 virginia beach vathis review also going ups july 6 pm brought amazon return package required sent via official ups store although read many negative review good service location many year happened today disgusting rating gone one trip 5 star 1 75 year old struggling unload truck bed carry large box containing collapsible wheel chair weighing approximately 50 lb got store double door entry open outside could hold box open door time propped box left side door one usually many business even unlocked held one hand knee opened right side door grip box entered store placed box ground open door would difficult time lifting one around could asked open door one exiting worker 2 people store greeted man hi today response would ok tried break door respectfully responded problem getting box always wonder store like door swing recall exact word threw receipt rudely left conversation walking back room said way something intelligence correctly open insulted stated see store many negative review responded back room remember exact word included get fyi absolutely abuse much less damage left side door mechanism propped box minor noise door set firmly latching id ed time drop case anyone associated store want know extremely rude employee owner far could see worker time little short side slightly heavy small black goatee suspect reading review could store 5 minute home much closer others town intend go need thankfully often one episode like never see

They provided the tracking number for them.  During two of the times the driver allegedly attempted to deliver, the business was open, doors unlocked and building was staffed.  The third alleged attempt was made at 5:30P.M. on Friday which was after business hours.  The doors were locked however I was in my office working.  My window faces the road where delivery trucks drive and I can hear knocking on the door if someone knocks.  I did not see nor hear the UPS driver.The security cameras don’t show any evidence that the UPS driver made any attempts to deliver the packages.  Additionally the driver did not leave any door tags showing that they attempted delivery.  We have had jobs on hold and employees unable to perform their duties because UPS never attempted to deliver these packages before returning them to the shipper.

1,Package Delivered to Wrong Address,"My package shipped via a global carrier but delivery is thru UPS did not arrive at the correct address. Instead, the incompetent delivery person delivered to a wrong address & did not image or take a picture as proof of delivery. Now, because of their incompetence, a one of kind non-replacable item is in some else's procession. I contacted UPS to complain, but all they did was apologize & opened an investigation to retrieve the package. But that is not going to work, because the package is another party's procession. Obviously, errors happen, but I receive numerous packages & many from UPS & they make it to the correct address without issue. So, it appears that UPS, does not hold their drivers accountable for wrong deliveries at a measure that sways their drivers to ACCURATELY read the label & deliver to the CORRECT address. Instead, they tell you that they can refund the shipper so as to refund you. The purpose of an order is to have it delivered, correctly, therefore an incorrect delivery does not meet that minimum standard, a correct delivery. When a driver delivers to a wrong address, that driver should be retained & all drivers measured for accuracy & failing means termination & accuracy is rewarded.","Aug 8, 2024",package shipped via global carrier delivery thru ups arrive correct address instead incompetent delivery person delivered wrong address image take picture proof delivery incompetence one kind item else procession contacted ups complain apologize opened investigation retrieve package going work package another party procession obviously error happen receive numerous package many ups make correct address without issue appears ups hold driver accountable wrong delivery measure sway driver accurately read label deliver correct address instead tell refund shipper refund purpose order delivered correctly therefore incorrect delivery meet minimum standard correct delivery driver delivers wrong address driver retained driver measured accuracy failing mean termination accuracy rewarded

Shortly afterward I got a call from Donal saying the driver had an incident and my parcel would not be delivered until after the weekend between 7am and 7pm and they couldn’t give a tighter window. Eventually my parcel arrived today. The driver apologized for the delay explaining that he had told his manager that he would be finishing at 12 last Friday and would be taking the undelivered parcels with him to Monaghan.

I waited and watched from my downstairs window overlooking my drive whilst browsing online to pass the time.  I have a doorbell and a door knocker and all the windows were open on a hot day.There was no UPS van or driver on foot that came to my house by lunchtime so I joined the UPS app to find out my parcel's progress. This showed that the delivery driver had filed to say that the delivery had been attempted and that my package would be delivered to the nearest ""hub"".

And did they fix the problem?? Absolutely not. I had gotten one answer from a manager in the morning, and a different answer in the afternoon from a different manager. The delivery driver thought it was appropriate to walk around my house instead of just staying at the front of my house. There was Zero need for him to go looking on the sides of my house and thank goodness I have cameras so that I have the backup proof that I need when I report them to the necessary agencies. I have a lot more I can say but I think I'll save it for the Better Business Bureau and other agencies that I'm reporting them to. I asked them for a solution to the problems, they didn't have one solution. They sure did have a lot of blankets statements such as ""I'm sorry"" or ""I understand"", however we all know that they do not. And whoever trained them in that poor shoddy customer service training should be fired. Because those statements just upset people more than they ever help.

Despite having clear delivery instructions and a properly labeled address, the driver consistently leaves my items at the wrong location. This has caused significant inconvenience and frustration, as I have had to track down my packages each time.I always file claims, and my poor supplier has to pay for the lost items because of this sorry company and their useless driver. UPS has a terrible app and website that are incredibly difficult to use, leading to even more frustration when trying to resolve issues. Attempting to call their customer service takes you nowhere and doesn’t help resolve the problems.I expect better from a reputable company like UPS. This lack of attention to detail and care in handling deliveries is unacceptable. I hope UPS takes immediate action to address this issue and improve its delivery services to ensure that packages reach their intended recipients without any hassle.","Aug 1, 2024",review ups driver service company employing one worst careless driver worldi extremely disappointed service provided ups recently experienced multiple instance package delivered wrong address despite clear delivery instruction properly labeled address driver consistently leaf item wrong location caused significant inconvenience frustration track package always file claim poor supplier pay lost item sorry company useless driver ups terrible app website incredibly difficult use leading even frustration trying resolve issue attempting call customer service take nowhere help resolve expect better reputable company like ups lack attention detail care handling delivery unacceptable hope ups take immediate action address issue improve delivery service ensure package reach intended recipient without hassle

1,Disaster to deal with a customer,"Ordered a package which had customs and duties, UPS offered a way to prepay those online but I was not going to use it only to have the package to go missing so intended to pay on delivery. My wife has done this numerous times and there was no indication prepayment was required. First delivery window came and went that got the message, ""driver was not able to receive payment"" despite no driver ever arriving (porch cam to prove it). Called customer service and got through ok and they were quite nice and said that they would make sure it was delivered the next day - tracking info agreed. Window came and went - no package - and again ""driver was not able..."". Contacted CS again and only then did they claim the duties had to be prepaid on line - I pointed out that there was no reason for me to trust them at this point so was not going to pay in advance. Was promised a call back from dispatch to address the issue or order would be cancelled with vendor. No call came. Called third time suggesting that they drop at a UPS store and I can pay there. CS first said, nope, we won't drop there until you prepay. Told them once again I would cancel order and ""surprise"" oh, okay you can pay there. I still needed assistance to set that up and demanded a call from dispatcher within hour. Never happened.

No further notification. No tracking of package available.  Call center is over seas and is useless.  All I wanted to do was to pick up my package myself which was supposedly at a center about 1 hour from my home.  After 4 phone calls I was told that I could not pick up the package myself.  I had to wait for a delivery.  This is the worse service I could ever image and I even paid for it.  Do NOT ever use UPS. FedEx and USPS are so much more efficient and I can always find the package. One particular person in the call center was so bad that she should be fired on the spot as 15 min of talking to her was a waste of time.  She would not even get me to a supervisor.

A local tradesman witnessed the UPS driver leaving after waiting for one minute- a family member was coming up the driveway to meet him and take delivery but the UPS driver drove off, sending a rude text message saying he 'couldn't wait'. Four subsequent deliveries were arranged and a further four times the driver did not attend at all- citing 'HOLIDAY DELAYS' falsely as a reason for non-delivery.

1,The Epitome of Incompetence and Frustration,"If you value your time, money, and sanity, avoid UPS at all costs. My recent experience with this abysmally managed company has been nothing short of a nightmare.First, UPS managed to lose my package after I had already paid the import fees online. This alone is unacceptable, but the ordeal didn't end there. Thankfully, the seller agreed to send my package again. However, UPS decided to torment me further with their sheer incompetence.For four consecutive days, I received false notifications about delivery attempts. Each day, I rescheduled my plans, ensuring I was home to receive the package. Each day, no one showed up. It's as if UPS gets some perverse pleasure out of misleading their customers. The customer service agents, whom I had the misfortune of speaking to, are some of the most incompetent people I have ever encountered. They provided no help and seemed utterly clueless about their own processes.Frustrated beyond measure, I agreed to drive to Richmond, a 30-minute drive from my home, to pick up my package. I was explicitly told by a customer service agent that my package was being held at this center. But upon arriving, I was informed that my package was with the driver. I had to return home empty-handed, wasting my time and fuel for nothing.Why would any person with integrity associate themselves with this institution is beyond me.

1,Stupid customer support and driver,"Customer support is a bunch of outsourced morons that keep robotically repeating the same useless stuff: ""As per checking bla bla bla contact your shipper"".Why I had to call customer support? Because I'm staying at a friend for a week and I'm having an Amazon package delivered to my friend's address. But the dimwitted UPS driver refused to deliver the package because... my name is not in the building directory.Of course it isn't! That's why I had put my friend's name as well in the address, but that apparently resulted in an ""invalid address exception"" that I had to correct on their site. Which I did. The next day - the same issue: package not delivered due to an address problem.Thing is, Amazon has my phone number on record, yet the driver NEVER CALLED ME so I could go meet them and sign for the damn package!So I'm on hold with support as I'm typing this review, trying to get them to drop the package at some UPS Access Point that I could pick it up from.

1,Consistently Failing to Deliver…,"I have been dealing with UPS for package deliveries this year, and I am extremely dissatisfied with their service. Here are the issues we've encountered on at least ten different occasions: Repeated Failure to Deliver on Time: UPS has consistently failed to deliver our packages on time. This has caused us significant inconvenience, especially when we have critical deadlines for projects and events.False Claims by the Fort Smith, AR Driver: We have caught the driver on camera several times falsely claiming that he attempted delivery. He has marked packages as requiring a signature and left notices without ever stepping out of his vehicle. On one occasion, he placed a notice on our travel trailer parked in front of the house, claiming he was afraid of our dogs, who were inside the house.Lack of Accountability: Despite numerous complaints, the local UPS center has shown a complete lack of concern. They refuse to escalate the matter to the center supervisor, even though this driver has a history of complaints.Discrimination Against Rural Areas: It is clear that UPS does not prioritize customers in rural areas. We are just 9 miles past two towns with over 110k people, yet we are treated as a low priority. FedEx and other vendors manage to deliver to us without any issues, proving that our location is not the problem.Overall, UPS's service has been abysmal, and their lack of response to our complaints shows that they do not care about their customers. I would not recommend UPS to anyone who needs reliable and timely deliveries.","Jul 19, 2024",dealing ups package delivery year extremely dissatisfied service issue encountered least ten different occasion repeated failure deliver time ups consistently failed deliver package time caused u significant inconvenience especially critical deadline project claim fort smith ar driver caught driver camera several time falsely claiming attempted delivery marked package requiring signature left notice without ever stepping vehicle one occasion placed notice travel trailer parked front house claiming afraid dog inside accountability despite numerous complaint local ups center shown complete lack concern refuse escalate matter center supervisor even though driver history rural area clear ups prioritize customer rural area 9 mile past two town 110k people yet treated low priority fedex vendor manage deliver u without issue proving location ups service abysmal lack response complaint show care customer would recommend ups anyone need reliable timely delivery

I will remove it once the problem is resolved.When calling customer service at 1-800-782-7892 or 1-888-742-5877, the automated system asks for a tracking number.

This prevents me from ever speaking to a human representative.In today's world, improving customer service is crucial for business growth. If UPS cannot resolve customer issues, people will turn to competitors, resulting in a loss of market share.

1,Shipping & Mailing Internationally to Mexico,"I needed to mail an unactivated debit card from the US to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.

After my initial complaint to the local UPS location from where it was originally sent in Seneca SC, they produced an internal document attached here showing mailing a debit card/credit card was prohibited despite the information in the document not being available pubicly beforehand and saying they could not refund the wasted $96 USD and could not possibly be expected to be responsible to all the places to where they ship.

1,#### Complaint about Delivery…,"#### Complaint about Delivery Experience**Summary:**The delivery man arrived with parcels, one of which had a £30 duty to be paid. However, he insisted on cash payment and could not accept card. As I didn't have cash at home and the office closed at 2pm, I couldn't pay by phone. Consequently, he took both parcels away, leaving me no option to pay. Subsequently, I received an email stating that one parcel was not delivered, while the other one was. This experience was very unprofessional, and I found it frustrating that the option to pay online was not communicated to me by the driver.**Details:**The delivery man brought parcels, one of which required a £30 duty payment in cash. Despite my lack of cash at home and the closure of the office at 2pm, the delivery man refused card payment and suggested I pay by phone. However, due to the time, I couldn't pay by phone as the office had already closed. As a result, he took both parcels away, leaving me unable to pay for the duty.Later, I received an email stating that one parcel was not delivered, while the other one was. This experience left me feeling very frustrated and disappointed with the unprofessionalism of the delivery service. Upon attempting to pay online, I found it to be a much more convenient option than paying by phone. It's perplexing why the driver did not inform me of this method, which could have resolved the issue immediately. As a result of this experience, I strongly advise others to avoid this delivery company and consider using alternative services to avoid similar stressful situations.**Conclusion:**I am now faced with the task of tracking down the delivered parcel that was never left, which has left me feeling absolutely furious about the entire experience.","Jul 17, 2024",complaint delivery experience summary delivery man arrived parcel one duty paid however insisted cash payment could accept card cash home office closed 2pm could pay phone consequently took parcel away leaving option pay subsequently received email stating one parcel delivered one experience unprofessional found frustrating option pay online communicated driver detail delivery man brought parcel one required duty payment cash despite lack cash home closure office 2pm delivery man refused card payment suggested pay phone however due time could pay phone office already closed result took parcel away leaving unable pay received email stating one parcel delivered one experience left feeling frustrated disappointed unprofessionalism delivery service upon attempting pay online found much convenient option paying phone perplexing driver inform method could resolved issue immediately result experience strongly advise others avoid delivery company consider using alternative service avoid similar stressful situation conclusion faced task tracking delivered parcel never left left feeling absolutely furious entire experience

1,UPS Don't Deliver and Leadership Don't Care.,"Update: The United States Post Office had and delivered my package.UPS has given me every right to believe that their drivers are stealing packages, and telling the office that the package has been delivered.... UPS has delivered my package EVERYWHERE ELSE but to me. This is not the first time, I had this problem with UPS. And If I had known, that the Seller was going to use UPS, I would not have purchased the item, because I never get my packages (with the exception of one time, when I contacted Headquarters).... Today UPS documented that my package was delivered and left at the Post Office, the Post Office didn't have the package. So where's my package (rhetorical)??? UPS have supposedly left my package twice, with people in my building who I don't know, and I never received those packages. The one time that I did receive the package (after complaining to headquarters), I caught the driver/deliverer ""still"" handing off my package to the person next door in my building (he rang her door bell and not mine- the package had my apt #). When the person next door realized that I was standing at my door (I saw the UPS truck outside, Headquarters told me that the driver was histhe way, so I knew he had my package,with my apt. #) she looked at the package and gave me the package. So, fast forward to today. I go to the post office and they received no package from UPS with my name. I immediately contacted the seller to let them know that I didn't receive the package, neither do the Post Office have the package. Next Steps...First, I'm grateful for platforms like Trustpilot which allows transparency (positive or negative) for companies such as UPS...but this is not enough, complaining gets nothing done... Clearly UPS has yet to correct their drivers/delivers' actions, in my case and most likely in others. So, it's time to see if I have enough solid evidence to start a class action law suit. For legal purposes, it's comforting to see, that I am not the only customer who have been scammed by UPS..... So many customers repeatedly have had the same issues, and still nothing changed. We may have a case.","Updated Jul 18, 2024",update united state post office delivered given every right believe driver stealing package telling office package delivered ups delivered package everywhere else first time problem ups known seller going use ups would purchased item never get package exception one time contacted headquarters today ups documented package delivered left post office post office package package rhetorical ups supposedly left package twice people building know never received package one time receive package complaining headquarters caught still handing package person next door building rang door bell package apt person next door realized standing door saw ups truck outside headquarters told driver histhe way knew package apt looked package gave package fast forward today go post office received package ups name immediately contacted seller let know receive package neither post office package next step first grateful platform like trustpilot allows transparency positive negative company ups enough complaining get nothing done clearly ups yet correct action case likely others time see enough solid evidence start class action law suit legal purpose comforting see customer scammed ups many customer repeatedly issue still nothing changed may case

The staff was disorganized, unprofessional, and showed a lack of care towards their customers. I visited the store to have 12 pieces of paper printed from a PDF document. Despite discussing the request in person, emailing the document, and receiving confirmation that they could print the 12 pages, I was shocked to find out that they hadn't even started the printing process after waiting for one and a half days. Their lack of urgency and disregard for my time, and lack of a phone call, was unacceptable.  Thankfully, I decided to go to FedEx as a last resort. They were able to print the document in less than 30 seconds and provided excellent service. I was impressed with their efficiency and professionalism.Overall, my experience at this location was a complete letdown.

1,Do not use UPS!,"I work in shipping and Receiving at a local company in Vancouver Canada.  I want to be clear that I am not writing this out of anger or rage; I am writing this to warn others who are trying to decide on a courier to use for business, personal, or other.Out of every courier I deal with on a daily basis (we work with FedEx, UPS, CanadaPost, Amazon, DHL, K&H, AirNorth, and several local couriers), UPS is absolutely the sloppiest, most careless and rude company out of them all.  It's a rare occurrence for our UPS packages to arrive unharmed in some way.  Whether the drivers drop them on the concrete floor of our warehouse and leave without a word, or there is one (or more) huge gash(es) in the cardboard, there is frequent damage to the goods.  As of today (July 10th, 2024), we were informed that UPS damaged our parcel beyond repair and discarded the package, with no refund or compensation for the crime. Another example is when a driver came to pick up a parcel we were shipping to the USA, and claimed we had the wrong paperwork for the item.  This was a rush order that needed to be delivered in 1 business day, so it was very expensive to ship.  He took our 3 commercial invoices out of the package and said they weren't needed.  This package was then reported as lost due to lack of proper paperwork.  The driver claimed 0 responsibility and said we should've had 3 commercial invoices next time we saw him.  It honestly astounds me that a company like this is as popular as they are.  If you're shipping a cheap item that you couldn't care less about, only then would I say that UPS is a safe bet, although their rates are higher than other couriers we use (such as FedEx).  Choosing UPS is a certain recipe for disaster.","Jul 10, 2024",work shipping receiving local company vancouver canada want clear writing anger rage writing warn others trying decide courier use business personal every courier deal daily basis work fedex ups canadapost amazon dhl k h airnorth several local courier ups absolutely sloppiest careless rude company rare occurrence ups package arrive unharmed way whether driver drop concrete floor warehouse leave without word one huge gash e cardboard frequent damage good today july 10th 2024 informed ups damaged parcel beyond repair discarded package refund compensation crime another example driver came pick parcel shipping usa claimed wrong paperwork item rush order needed delivered 1 business day expensive ship took 3 commercial invoice package said needed package reported lost due lack proper paperwork driver claimed 0 responsibility said 3 commercial invoice next time saw honestly astounds company like popular shipping cheap item could care less would say ups safe bet although rate higher courier use fedex choosing ups certain recipe disaster

1,I was waiting for 2 parcels from Cruise…,"I was waiting for 2 parcels from Cruise Fashion. They use DPD, which use UPS for shipping. Both parcels were at a drop-off point on July 3rd and when I went to pick them up on July 6th, they had disappeared and nobody knew where they were. Turned out a UPS driver had mistakenly taken them and returned them to UPS. After that I had to phone UPS 6 times on Monday to ask that they deliver the parcels to my house. They delivered one parcel yesterday and the other one went missing. UPS said they had the other one and they would deliver it today. This morning, tracking indicated that someone had requested a delivery reschedule and they would deliver on Friday. Who asked for that reschedule??? Nobody knows! I won't be home tomorrow and I'm leaving on Friday, so I asked a delivery for today.They said they would arrange it and someone would call me within an hour. Nobody called. I called back. They said that since someone (a mysterious entity, not me that's for sure!) had requested a delivery reschedule , it would take 48 hours to process the parcel.They suggested that I go myself to the other end of town, over one hour away, 2 hours or more at rush hour to pick-up the parcel at their warehouse. I have no other choice but to do that. But of course, things are not that easy: I have to wait 2 hours for a confirmation that the parcel is ready to pick-up. But guess what is even worse: I just tracked my parcel again and... now delivery has been rescheduled to July 19th!!!  Hahaha! When and how will this end? Is there a ghost in UPS's system? Are they hacked? Those mysterious delivery change requests keep appearing and nobody at UPS is able to tell me who makes them. I have been keeping Cruise Fashion updated about each step of this saga and all they did was to tell me that they were sorry and that they would notify DPD (the broker between them and UPS). I am beside myself with frustration. It's the worst experience I have ever had with shipping, by very far. The only other terrible experience I had was also with UPS. They lost a parcel and it was recovered several months later at their warehouse... Bravo UPS!

1,Wish I could give zero stars,"Wish I could give zero stars. I have a package being delivered via UPS that needs a signature. The initial tracking said that it would be here on Tuesday. When I arrived home Monday evening, there was a notification on my door that I had missed the delivery attempt but they would try again tomorrow. Ok. When tomorrow arrived, I checked the tracking and it said it would be delivered between 230 and 4:30 PM, I work and I had to make arrangements to be home during That timeframe, So I could sign for my package. I checked the tracking later and it had changed to between 4:45 PM and 8:30 PM. I made new arrangements to be home during that time frame. When I arrived home at 4:30 there was a notification on my door that they had come at 3 PM to attempt my delivery!!!! Far outside their delivery window! I called and spoke with Ken and he was amazing and put in an urgent message for the dispatcher to call me. When the dispatch manager George called me, he promptly hung up on me because he thought I should accept his excuse that that’s just an estimated timeframe. Your whole existence is around the delivery of packages. Your timeframe is YOUR JOB! literally, what are you doing??? Because you’re not delivering packages, which is your whole business model. I am also in the business of customer service and sales and I would never, NEVER treat any customer the way I was treated today by UPS by multiple different employees, which tells me this is acceptable to UPS. I have requested that they allow me to pick up my package instead because they cannot do their job, but it’s been 30 minutes and I’ve not heard back from them. So maybe passive aggressively not going to deliver my package to me? Is that where we are? Kind of seems that way. The representatives from UPS that I spoke with multiple, besides Ken who was amazing, all were awful!! They had zero customer service skills, had zero empathy. You told me you would be delivering my packages that I have to sign for, during a certain time. I then had no choice but to plan my day around that, and then you did not deliver what you said. That is your whole business. And then your employees spoke to me like it was just a normal thing to not deliver packages as they should be delivered—When that is your entire existence. It’s almost as if you don’t care about my business.. Don’t worry, I got your message loud and clear you don’t want my business and I will never give it to you again. Every single person I spoke to at your company today besides Ken, needs training on customer service and customer experience.

1,My husband’s Cancer Medicine stuck in a warehouse,"I just wish to express my EXTREME frustration and dissatisfaction with UPS!   Especially since Rich ironically retired from UPS after 29 yrs!    We’re up at camp in Ignace Ontario, enjoying our summer, after the reassurance that there would be no problem shipping Rich’s VITAL monthly prescription to a location in Dryden, Ontario.    June’s prescription was delivered flawlessly.   Unfortunately, July’s delivery, shipped the last week of June, IS SITTING IN A WAREHOUSE IN WINNIPEG, MANITOBA, being scanned twice daily for 6 days now!!!!!     Yesterday, I spent over 5 frustrating hours trying to reach somebody, to be dumped into “Hold Hell!”, told outright lies that shipping info is incorrect, (while I’m reading the correct info on the shipping label”, was told CUSTOMS didn’t have the correct Comnercial Invoice.  I then spoke with the UPS store in WI, and she reassured me that she had called WINNIPEG, and they DID have the invoice - another lie on the International UPS part.  Finally, today, I called the Canadian Customs Services, and, without sitting on hold AT ALL, I spoke with a very informative and helpful gentleman named, Ryan.    Turns out that UPS has their own customs brokers and blaming customs was just another lie!    Yesterday, I informed the 5 or 6 people from UPS domestic And International customer service that this was absolutely VITAL, $3,000.00 a month medicine and it costs us $146.44 EACH TIME WE SHIP FROM WI TO DRYDEN, ON!   In the shipping labels stated “Medicine While Traveling” !   In summary, there is no plausable excuse for holding a small 1 lb box in the UPS warehouse other than ineptitude and extremely poor customer service!

I go the holding location 30 minutes away, only to say that they have changed their hours since they are short staffed. They do not have a phone number also, so I could not have verified what their hours were.

It already charged $10 to change the date but it still won't change the date.

1,UPS has no functioning customer service,"UPS doesn't have a significant presence in Norway. I make it a point not to purchase from companies that ship via UPS.

I did receive a text message instructing me to reply with ""2"" to have the package delivered to my home instead. Unfortunately, I didn't get any confirmation, and the situation doesn't look promising. The UPS My Choice service is ineffective; I'm unable to make any changes there.

1,Package arrived water logged,"Package arrived water logged.   I mean it was so drenched that nuts and bolts sealed in a ziplock type of bag was drenched and starting to rust.They switched the outer box,  replaced all the articles from the original box and put it into a new box to conceal the fact that the products (skates) were wet an growing mold.   Then Ugly Piece of S  put a spin on the situation and decided to tell me that I was lucky because UPS was going to put file a claim.   I listened to the bozo give me some convoluted statement and he ended up fessing that I would eventually have to get the reimbursement for the items.    Wait....  they water logged my purchased items and tells me that it is the shipper fault since theyshould have put insurance on it.     They water log my purchased items, then switch box (which is illegal) and then tell me it's the shipper's problem because they should have insured it.Ugly Piece of S should have delivered it without damaging it.   The story goes on even further.  The shipper (store) has to now file a claim against Ugly Piece of S and get a measly 100 USD to cover my 880 dollars worth of goods.  I don't think the shop will be willing to reimburse me for anything.   UPS says all legit shops will do that.  Like they would know, after all they aren't going to fight for my reimbursement.On  Reddit and other forums, there are 100s of UPS scammers (workers) writing in, trying to convolute the problem by avoiding the problem or replacing the problem with '' they should have insured it''.  Even if it were insured, there is no guarantee that I will get reimbursed for the water logged items.  Long story short, the items should not have been water logged from the get go.UPS is basically a scam company which will not take responsibility for the horrible mistakes they make.

Who the UPS phone reps put both responsibility for the package getting damaged and for providing reimbursement on, although nothing went wrong with the package until the local UPS delivery got their hands on it. My package contained multiple small, expensive items and I had wanted it still delivered to salvage what I could. Other postal or delivery services have delivered damaged, stained, or soaked packages to me but UPS refused to deliver what was already on the van en route to my home because of ""damage"". If it wasn't too much of a problem to keep on the van in order to be investigated later it certainly shouldn't have been an issue to still deliver. It was 30+ aggravating minutes on the phone to find all this out, once tracking ceased after the damage notification.

2,Avoid if possible,"This feedback is based on multiple deliveries over the past year.I gave 1 star as I've always received my packages (in the end) and 1 star because they're usually in good condition (although once a package was unrecognizable).But as most others have pointed out, it takes a minor miracle for UPS to actually delivery to your door and/or contact you about your shipment. They say they've attempted delivery, but unless you live in a house, they never attempt to get the package to you and don't inform you of the status of the shipment.After checking the status of the shipment yourself and seeing the 'delivery attempt', you can contact UPS to have the shipment delivered to a local pick-up point (else you'll have to pick it up from their office in Vantaa).Their customer service is polite but they give worthless information about your shipment -- if they say it will be delivered by a certain time/date, you know it's going to be a few days later than quoted.Also, their drivers do not have phones, thus they have no way to contact you for help with directions or getting your door code. It's dumbfounding this is still the case in 2024.In conclusion, avoid having your shipment delivered by UPS if at all possible.

5,Exceptional Customer Service Experience with UPS during Parcel Hold-Up,"I am thrilled to share my recent experience with UPS involving the delivery of a parcel from Spain to the UK. Despite facing an unexpected delay due to the parcel being held by the Spain Government Agency for three weeks, the outstanding customer service I received from UPS, particularly from two remarkable individuals, Maria and Bea, truly made a significant difference in resolving the issue.Upon encountering the delay, I reached out to UPS customer service in the UK for assistance. Initially, I faced challenges as I received conflicting information from different customer advisers during numerous phone calls. Feeling frustrated, I decided to visit the Stanford UPS depot, where I had the pleasure of meeting Maria King a highly professional and friendly customer adviser. Maria went above and beyond to assist me, ensuring that I would receive my parcel at the earliest convenience.Moreover, my interactions with Bea, another exceptional member of the UPS team, were equally remarkable. Bea assured me that she would personally handle my case and utilize all available resources to expedite the release of my parcel from the Spain Government Agency. Throughout the process, Bea kept me informed with regular updates, displaying a high level of commitment and dedication to resolving my issue promptly.It is undeniable that without the unwavering dedication and exceptional customer service provided by Maria and Bea, my parcel may have never been released from the hold-up in Spain. Their professionalism, kindness, and determination to assist me in every possible way are truly commendable.I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Maria and Bea for their outstanding support, patience, and relentless efforts in resolving my parcel issue efficiently. Their exemplary service has left a lasting impression on me, and I am truly grateful for their exceptional assistance during this challenging situation.

Furthermore, it was urgent to complete my online registration prior to my major trip within days.

Once the tracking info arrived, I was disappointed to see UPS as the courier, yet surprised to see a next day delivery on Wednesday. Come 9pm on Wednesday, there had been no mobile/text updates which I had specifically signed up for. Checking the website there was a notification that the shipment was delayed due to ""mechanical failure"" - what, one of your trucks broke down and you don't have another one? The bar code reader's batteries were flat? Someone spilt coffee on the keyboard and there isn't a spare one? No further information regarding delivery days/times or progress, no web chat available, no email response, 45 mins in a queue on the phone only to be told that I should check the tracking details online... the standard incompetent, useless customer service that typifies UPS.

1,Complaint Against Dell for Mishandled…,"Complaint Against Dell for Mishandled Delivery and Poor Customer ServiceOn April 23, 2024, I purchased a notebook from the Dell website (Order Number: 1004121341, Dell Purchase ID: 2008306306995). I made the payment and awaited delivery. Unfortunately, Dell delivered the package to an incorrect address, where it was received by an individual named Fabricio. I personally contacted Fabricio, who informed me that he had returned the package.I then reached out to UPS (Tracking ID:1ZW70W980316759362), the courier service entirely contracted by Dell, to investigate the whereabouts of my package. However, UPS stated that I needed authorization from Dell to proceed with the investigation. This situation exemplifies a series of errors and a troubling lack of accountability between the companies involved, leaving me, the consumer, with violated rights and significant financial and emotional distress. Moreover, I urgently require this notebook for my work.I have contacted Dell support numerous times, only to be repeatedly attended to by an inadequate representative named Shane, who seems solely interested in sending automated responses rather than resolving customer issues.This entire experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing.

1,Why is zero not an option?,"I chose one star only because zero was not an option. Yesterday UPS delivered a package to me.. I was waiting on some Amazon so I grabbed it and opened it only to realize I didn’t recognize it as anything I’d ordered. Upon looking, it was addressed to my address but for someone I don’t know (in someone else’s name) so I made the epically horrible decision to call the customer service number. As I’ve sadly come to expect, a robot answered and I patiently listened and waited for my opportunity to request an agent. *spoiler alert : no matter what you say this thing will not connect you to a person but if you utterly get belligerent with it, she eventually says “I can’t connect you to an agent” and as you hit repeat lol because you can’t believe what you just heard and hear clearly “I can’t connect you to an agent” the urge to throw your phone into your yard is overwhelming paired with a desire to slap the bot in the face then you realize it has no face and you laugh and get on FB , type in the name on the package, send this person a msg telling them what happened then they drive to your house and get it and everyone is happy. However, I feel that I did the job of a UPS employee yesterday and I would like to know who to call to get my direct deposit going.. because you guys know that it sometimes takes a check or two for that to kick in so I’d like that number asap please. I did enjoy my interaction with the local UPS store tho.. this guy was hilarious and hated to tell me that he could not reach drivers and I’d probably have to go to the hub as apparently the hub has no phone. I could tell by his tone that he was ashamed at that moment, to be affiliated with UPS. Lastly, don’t try to prove me wrong, don’t call the number thinking, that woman must be exaggerating, because by the time you realize you are genuinely infuriated with an inanimate figure, basically just a computer generated voice, and you’re screaming AGENT!! HUMAN!! Well, at that point it’s just too late.

1,Extremely disappointing and frustrating experience with UPS,"I recently had my first experience with UPS when I needed to send a letter with important documents. Initially, the procedures seemed fine – I created an account, logged in, and generated a label to attach to the letter. However, several drop-off locations were unfamiliar with scanning such packages, likely due to lower usage compared to the national postal service.I received a receipt indicating that the letter would arrive within a couple of days. However, tracking soon showed that the letter sat in a warehouse for over a week without any movement. After several calls to UPS, I encountered polite but not particularly helpful representatives. They informed me that I had used the wrong postage and that this service option was not available for Italy. How could I have known, given that it already cost several hundred kroner for a small letter?After locating the letter somewhere in their system and scanning it, UPS decided to return the letter to me due to incorrect postage. I made more calls and eventually received an email instructing me to create a new label with additional postage, costing another hundred kroner. I sent the new label via email but received no response. Nearly two days and multiple calls later, I was informed that the letter was finally on its way to the recipient, now with a new tracking number. Shortly afterward, I learned that the letter had arrived.After many years of using the Norwegian postal service, this was the worst, slowest, and most expensive experience I've ever had. UPS needs significant improvements in their service and customer support to match even basic expectations.","Jun 20, 2024",recently first experience ups needed send letter important document initially procedure seemed fine created account logged generated label attach letter however several location unfamiliar scanning package likely due lower usage compared national postal received receipt indicating letter would arrive within couple day however tracking soon showed letter sat warehouse week without movement several call ups encountered polite particularly helpful representative informed used wrong postage service option available italy could known given already cost several hundred krone small letter locating letter somewhere system scanning ups decided return letter due incorrect postage made call eventually received email instructing create new label additional postage costing another hundred krone sent new label via email received response nearly two day multiple call later informed letter finally way recipient new tracking number shortly afterward learned letter many year using norwegian postal service worst slowest expensive experience ever ups need significant improvement service customer support match even basic expectation

1,UPS Delivery Problems,"I'm so sick of UPS drivers' apathy when it comes to alerting customers that their packages have arrived. Why don't they have the courtesy to knock on the door? I live in an apartment complex, and there's only been one instance when a UPS driver knocked on my door in the last year to pick up a return. Usually they just stuff the labels in my door knocker and run off. I'm charged $7.99 by Amazon whenever I need a return picked up at home. I'm terminally ill so that's more often than not. I have to call Amazon back and report the incident and hope they can resolve it with UPS and have them come back again. As frustrating as that is, it's nothing compared to having drivers leave packages outside my door without so much as a knock to let me know it's arrived. I shouldn't have to check the tracking number every 5 minutes or risk another resident hovering over it or worse, my order gone without a trace and UPS asking me to provide proof of my word. How can I prove my driver didn't knock or yell or make any noise at all?   Of course they apologize for any bad experience and promise to note my account with instructions to ""Knock hard"". I'm always home and always in my living room. Both of my doors are in the living room so there's no excuse. I'm going to request that they hand packages and labels to me, but I expect that to go over like a lead balloon. Every once in awhile I'll hear them rustling around outside, but by the time I get to the door, they are either in their truck or in a dead run toward it. Call for them all you want. They won't even look back.

So they can't contact the driver, but left him a note(?) that package should be left at the access point. But it was never left there.

I was told by 5 different staff members, my parcel was 100% guaranteed to be delivered by 5pm on the 13th June 2023. This was a complete lie. The dealership closes at 6pm every day and the specified delivery on the app said 7pm even though it's a business address and have been told by countless staff that the business address deliveries finish at 5pm. The staff have no care or respect within the company. They tell you what you want! I then told them that as a result of them failing to uphold this guarantee, my parcel MUST under no circumstance, be delivered later than 11am on the 14th June 2024. Again staff guaranteed this would happen. They have yet again failed! As a result I am going to be charged an additional £200-£300 storage fee from the dealership! The staff do not care about it's customers, problems or concerns. This is totally unacceptable. They state they are the fastest service and most caring, again clearly that's more lies from the company. I will be taking this action much farther. I have a scheduled interview with the Daily Mail and The Sun Newspapers.

Fortunately, someone at UPS managed to remove the glass shards before hastily repacking the box.The delivery driver provided no explanation for the incidents, merely shrugging and requesting my signature for the damaged goods.One bottle breaking can be considered an accident.

5,I had written a prior review on this…,"I had written a prior review on this company dealing with this specific shipment that I am giving a 5 star review on.So what changed to make me write a 5 star review? It's because of one individual at the Fort Erie, ON, Canada location who helped tremendously in getting this sorted out.I was given incorrect data by the UPS agent who suggested that I do a self assessment to eliminate the brokerage charges that had been left on the item after I provided proof of purchase that the items were being returned to me. He told me that I could do a self assessment even though the goods had been cleared by customs in Fort Erie. He emailed the individual in charge of clearance at Fort Erie and she sent me the instructions on what to do, which included a copy of the commercial invoice that was filled out by me (I did this online and sent the label to the friend who was sending this item back to me).I went to the Canadian Border Services Agency office located at Hamilton Airport last Friday (31st May) and was given a bunch of arbitrary data by the Agent there. I was asked for a cargo control manifest number which is impossible to get after an item has been cleared and released by customs. He knew this but I didn't and he sent me on a wild goose chase. So I went back on June the 4th with more proof of who I was and I spoke to a different agent who was the one who told me that once it clears customs they have nothing to do with it. He then inferred that I had not given the correct data the first time I had been (on the 31st May), which I had but used different words - 'its out on delivery' instead of 'its been cleared by customs'. It can't be out on delivery UNLESS it has been cleared by customs so the agent on the 31st of May was quite the ass****. The second time I waited for 20+ minutes for someone to come up to the window at the CBSA. The original chap refused to come to the window even though that was his job. So a chap with the nametag Armstrong talked to me. I wish I had talked to him originally.Anyway, I left empty handed without the B15 which UPS were trying to get from me to cancel the brokerage charges. I stopped off at a nearby community center to call Tracy at UPS in Fort Erie and she said she would do what she could to get the brokerage charges removed. She called me the next day and sent an email to say that all brokerage charges had been removed and that I could pick up my item locally myself. Without Tracy helping me this outcome would not have happened. Thank You!!!!A word about the agents who answer the phone... there were at least two agents who, when they put me on hold inadvertently put me through to the survey, hence ending the call. I had to ring back each time to get back to a supervisor. In total I spent over 12 hours on the phone with UPS calling the regular number to try and get this resolved. And the supervisor who told me to do the self assessment was wrong. One CANNOT self assess unless one does so BEFORE the shipment is shipped. This way the item, when it arrives at the clearing port, will be held until CBSA can visually check the goods.And the CBSA agent who sent me on a wild goose chase, if I had remembered your name from your nametag I would have mentioned it here.

I could not find out when UPS would try again ('next working day'), so tried phoning the only contact number given (a USA number) but the automated voice recognition did not work.  I then used 'chat' and after a delay one of their staff responded, but then had to refer me to another person on chat - I waited at least 10-15 mins as instructed but the call seemed to have ended, as no one responded.  So I gave up and emailed UPS. No response yet - only a request to complete a customer survey.  UPS offers the option of joining a UPS customer programme to allow control over delivery times - I tried to join, provided all my personal data, and then found that whatever I had joined did not seem to give me the delivery date control options.  UPS makes it impossible to speak to a human being - only to a machine, which is very demoralising.   So all in all, I find UPS dysfunctional, unhelpful, and inaccessible.  According to the tracker, the delivery was then scheduled for the next day between 13:40 and 15:40hrs.  In fact, it was delivered and left in the porch at 08:04hrs.

1,Is UPS even following the law?,"As a customer eagerly awaiting multiple delayed packages crucial for my upcoming vacation, One of which appears to just be sitting in a warehouse for days with no updates, I find myself frustrated and deeply concerned by the inefficiencies plaguing UPS, as highlighted in a recent Reddit post I came across created by UPS workers. The inability to provide a delivery date for one of my packages is unacceptable, especially considering the ample time it has been in their possession with no explanation as to why it hasn’t arrive nor has it left the last warehouse it was reported to be at. The revelations from UPS employees about packages not being properly processed, returned, or even misplaced due to lack of adequate staffing and clerical support raise serious doubts about UPS's commitment to customer service and operational integrity. It appears that UPS may be violating consumer rights and possibly even engaging in false advertising by failing to deliver on their promises of reliable and timely package delivery services.These issues may potentially violate consumer protection laws, particularly in terms of false advertising and failure to deliver services as promised. The lack of proper staffing and support for clerical duties not only disrupts the delivery process but also puts undue burden and responsibility on drivers, leading to further delays and potential errors.Furthermore, the reduction in clerk positions and the imposition of unrealistic workload restrictions, as described by UPS employees, not only compromise the efficiency of operations but also raise concerns about workplace safety and employee well-being. It's alarming to hear about safety hazards emerging as a result of these operational changes, highlighting a blatant disregard for both customer satisfaction and employee welfare.UPS's failure to address these systemic issues not only jeopardizes customer trust and satisfaction but also raises serious ethical and legal concerns regarding their business practices. As a loyal customer, I urge UPS to take immediate and comprehensive action to rectify these issues and ensure that such incidents do not recur in the future.","Jun 3, 2024",customer eagerly awaiting multiple delayed package crucial upcoming vacation one appears sitting warehouse day update find frustrated deeply concerned inefficiency plaguing ups highlighted recent reddit post came across created ups worker inability provide delivery date one package unacceptable especially considering ample time possession explanation arrive left last warehouse reported revelation ups employee package properly processed returned even misplaced due lack adequate staffing clerical support raise serious doubt ups commitment customer service operational integrity appears ups may violating consumer right possibly even engaging false advertising failing deliver promise reliable timely package delivery issue may potentially violate consumer protection law particularly term false advertising failure deliver service promised lack proper staffing support clerical duty disrupts delivery process also put undue burden responsibility driver leading delay potential reduction clerk position imposition unrealistic workload restriction described ups employee compromise efficiency operation also raise concern workplace safety employee alarming hear safety hazard emerging result operational change highlighting blatant disregard customer satisfaction employee failure address systemic issue jeopardizes customer trust satisfaction also raise serious ethical legal concern regarding business practice loyal customer urge ups take immediate comprehensive action rectify issue ensure incident recur future

1,HORRIBLE,"HORRIBLE — once again!!!HORRIBLE — AGAIN!! UPS (so far just on the weekends) keeps delivering to locations that are NOT my house! Two weeks ago I found my shipment a couple of acres over on another property (with no house) thrown on the ground in the weeds. Today my two packages were delivered at the bottom of the hill I live on, in my garbage collection area (EWW) and they’re both 100#’s so I can’t lift them into my car! I’m a pretty fit 54 year old and the dead weight of these items is just much to lift. So the company I ordered from, Frontgate, has had to issue a return ticket in order to get UPS out here to pick them back up and ship them back to them. They re-ordered my items and we’re crossing our fingers that they’ll arrive during the week when the driver will actually bring them up to my house. Unfortunately, UPS’s all electronic “customer service“ makes it impossible to get ahold of a person and try to send the driver back or find some other resolution. I’m to the point where I’m starting to ask companies I order from who they ship with and I won’t buy from them if they don’t offer something other than UPS. It’s so sad, as their customer service has gone down the toilet. I’m still dealing with a shipment that never arrived about a month ago and their driver claims he delivered them to the right place, and gave the name of a person that doesn’t work at the location it was to be delivered to. So I’m just eating that $300. Horrible company now — too bad I can only list one date and tracking number on this rating.

I was actually answering my door to a DPS courier at exactly the time UPS gave for their supposed delivery attempt. 08.49amAccording to several UPS employees on Reddit UPS do this when an item is loaded onto the wrong vehicle so it may well not have been the driver telling lies.I called their customer service line to be told that they would contact the depot and have them call me.A lady from the depot called me at 10.29 to say they had asked the driver to re deliverand she would call back to confirm.An hour later I had heard nothing so called customer service again. Was told they would chase up the depot and I would be contacted within 60 minutes.90 minutes later, still no contact so I called customer service again and asked for a supervisor.30 minutes later supervisor called me back. It’s now 2.30 pm. He was very apologetic and said he would chase the depot personally.An hour later he called back and said the depot had refused to deliver today. Just couldn’t be bothered to tell me.A whole day wasted calling for information which I could have been given at 10.30 and all because they lied to me on the first instance.I should add that all the customer service employees genuinely tried to help. It’s the management who made these shameful decisions and hid behind them that I am incandescent with rage about.It’s now 8pm and I have chased them up 8 times now. Still no call from the depot despite being told each time I called customer service that the depot would call.Asked to speak to a supervisor again and was left on hold for 30 minutes and finally disconnected.Clearly they couldn’t care less about their customers or their customers recipients.I will be advising the eBay vendor just how bad this service has been.U nbelievablyP oorS erviceDate of experience: 30 May 2024","May 30, 2024",utter false attempted delivery notification actually answering door dp courier exactly time ups gave supposed delivery attempt several ups employee reddit ups item loaded onto wrong vehicle may well driver telling called customer service line told would contact depot call lady depot called say asked driver deliverand would call back hour later heard nothing called customer service told would chase depot would contacted within 60 minute later still contact called customer service asked minute later supervisor called back pm apologetic said would chase depot hour later called back said depot refused deliver today bothered tell whole day wasted calling information could given lied first add customer service employee genuinely tried help management made shameful decision hid behind incandescent rage 8pm chased 8 time still call depot despite told time called customer service depot would speak supervisor left hold 30 minute finally care less customer customer advising ebay vendor bad service nbelievablyp oors ervicedate experience 30 may 2024

1,UPS = UNRELIABLE PRETEND SERVICES,"This company has rapidly declined in the last few years, with 2022 being a key marker for the start of a very noticeable decline.Once revered as a ‘giant’ and ‘leader’ in this industry, they have quickly become shockingly useless to the point where it begs to ask the question, ‘Why does any one, or business, use UPS as a parcel carrier in 2024?’.Seriously, I would welcome answers because I’m have an incredibly difficult time comprehending how paying money for nearly any service they offer is even considered legitimately performed as described. Main complaints surround the sheer unreliability of tracking (should any exist/function as an actual means of tracking) and all the inconsistencies and potential issues that almost certain will arise from using a logistics company that cannot even provide valid tracking updates and more times than less will truly have no idea where packages may be (often encouraging their own employees to help blur these lines).When you cannot properly track parcel, and said parcel is already ’moving’ at an exuberantly slow pace as it crawls across the United States not being tracked at all, missing guaranteed delivery dates by significant margins becomes an unacceptable norm.It remains unclear to me, and many others online, how exactly any individual or business can have any confidence in UPS these days. Is there a part of this joke that I’m missing? - Just another disappointed customer in the faceless sea of what I can only assume is tens of millions of individuals and businesses alike.

Twenty four-hour after getting my quote the rate the system quotes for exactly the same shipment is still $30.95. Any reasonably run company provides better service than UPS at a lower cost. Two good examples are FedEx which is consistently 25 to 30 lower than UPS and who is used for my shipment.

It appears as delivered and signed by a receptionist. So far I have reached to:- customer service multiple times- Investigation team requested to fill a form which I did straight away, resent it the next day cos didn't get a confirmation. And about 5 days later reach out again and the guy told ""I never fill up the form"" ... Yes because someone with plenty of expertise in the IT sector don't know how to fill up a form and attach it to an email. - Reach out to escalation team which asked me to fill again the form I had sent 3 times before.- Investigation team closed the investigation claiming ""lack of description""It is outrageous how these people just seem to pass the ball here and nobody taking responsibility for the customer packages.

The next day, it had a delivery date for that day but later, the delivery date was gone.  No delivery that day.  The next day, it had a date but ""On the way"" not ""Out for delivery"" so I called.  It took FOREVER to finally be able to speak to someone.  It shouldn't be so difficult to speak to a person.  The person I spoke to could not give me any information about why it hadn't been delivered. I needed the package so wanted to pick it up. I told the representative that. The website is ridiculous and I could not make arrangements to pick it up.Between tracking the package a ton of times, trying to call and speak to someone, being on hold, or waiting for delivery, this cost me A LOT of time.

1,Broken,"BrokenShipping and Receiving is difficult. Most people who are frustrated are waiting for something and find out it will be delayed or worse. However, the problem with UPS has nothing to do with those kinds of issues. It's that their system is deeply broken and it seems like rather than trying to fix it they are trying to slash prices further and further through very cheap automation. In the past year I have had probably 20 UPS deliveries, about 85% had significant issues and nearly all of them could have been solved by simple communication. UPS has painted themselves into a corner with cheapness and now the customer and service workers pay for it while those who implemented said system get paid for it. The one positive is they do sort of save me money, because when I see a company is using UPS exclusively I now don't purchase from them because I don't want to deal with the guaranteed issues.","May 2, 2024",brokenshipping receiving difficult people frustrated waiting something find delayed worse however problem ups nothing kind issue system deeply broken seems like rather trying fix trying slash price cheap automation past year probably 20 ups delivery 85 significant issue nearly could solved simple communication ups painted corner cheapness customer service worker pay implemented said system get paid one positive sort save money see company using ups exclusively purchase want deal guaranteed issue
1,"Delivered to Wrong House, Refused Claim","UPS delivered a customer's package to a random house and the driver included a ""proof of delivery"" photo of a porch with a dark brown door and a white wall with no address on it. The customer said that she never got the package and sent me a picture of her front porch with a light gray door with a wreath on it, a flowerbed, a pink table and a gray wall with her address on it. I wish that there was some way that I could attach both pictures to this review to show the vast difference between the house that the UPS driver delivered the package to and the house that actually belonged to the customer. Anyway, even after sending UPS pictures of the drastic difference between the driver's ""proof of delivery"" photo and the actual photo of the customer's house, UPS still refused our reimbursement claim since the driver took a picture of some random house. I think it is worth it to pay extra to use FedEx since their drivers are actually reliable and their customer service is good.","May 2, 2024",ups delivered customer package random house driver included proof delivery photo porch dark brown door white wall address customer said never got package sent picture front porch light gray door wreath flowerbed pink table gray wall address wish way could attach picture review show vast difference house ups driver delivered package house actually belonged customer anyway even sending ups picture drastic difference driver proof delivery photo actual photo customer house ups still refused reimbursement claim since driver took picture random house think worth pay extra use fedex since driver actually reliable customer service good

1,UPS lottery - sometimes they do find your address.,"Again you could not find my home address. Your excuse this time, as the other times is, that ""we attempted delivery, but not possible to deliver"". This is not true - it is a simple lie. I was home all day. The address is not a secret. Everybody else, from the pizza guy to the postal guy etc are able to find my house. And sometimes even UPS succeeded! The sender paid for the package to be delivered at the home address and it is should be delivered against a signature. So, UPS is charging for a service that also is not delivered. I believe, this is something they do with all packages in order to save fuel and salary cost. By dropping all the packages at a collection point, the save a lot. Plus they are still charging for the delivery.Customer service is arrogant and absolutely not willing to help in any way. They could of course ""make another attempt"" but then I would have to wait at least for a week - according to customer service.I think you are scamming people on a calculated risk by being taken to cost - due the insignificant amounts involved.Somebody should bring you to court for this scaming business.","May 2, 2024",could find home address excuse time time attempted delivery possible deliver true simple lie home day address secret everybody else pizza guy postal guy etc able find house sometimes even ups succeeded sender paid package delivered home address delivered signature ups charging service also delivered believe something package order save fuel salary cost dropping package collection point save lot plus still charging service arrogant absolutely willing help way could course make another attempt would wait least week according customer think scamming people calculated risk taken cost due insignificant amount bring court scaming business

I sent important documents to the Canadian embassy in Manila through UPS, expecting a smooth and efficient delivery process. However, it turned into a nightmare.Firstly, I was repeatedly call UPS customer service to locate my documents, to track my documents. The customer service representatives were absolutely clueless and seemed incompetent, providing vague and unhelpful responses.Their excuse for not being able to locate the Canadian embassy, a well-known location, is utterly unacceptable. If tourists and locals unfamiliar with Manila can find the embassy, how is it that a courier service like UPS cannot manage to do the same?To make matters worse, UPS failed to deliver the documents as promised. I had to resort to sending my brother and sister all the way from Batangas to Manila just to pick up the documents that UPS was supposed to deliver. This defeats the entire purpose of paying for a delivery service in the first place.Overall, UPS Philippines' inefficiency, lack of competence, and poor customer service have left me deeply dissatisfied and inconvenienced.

1,UPS deceives and mistreats their customer,"UPS deceives and mistreats their customers in terms of delivery. They failed to collect packages at the designated time, resulting in a one-day delay in the delivery process. They ended up delivering on Friday much sooner than the expected delivery time I was given.On the second attempt at delivery, the driver arrived on Saturday but was about to leave without leaving a note. However, someone from the house stopped the driver and asked why he was leaving. The driver explained that the package had been forgotten and was not loaded into his truck. Apologizing, he then informed them that they would have to wait until Monday to receive the package. On Monday, after utilizing the ineffective and untrustworthy MyChoice UPS App, it indicated that the driver approached my location but subsequently returned to the warehouse by 6 pm. I contacted their customer service line and was informed that the tracking information I possessed was incorrect, as per their records, the package was still in the process of being delivered. The UPS rep told me to give the driver ample time to deliver my package by 9:00pm. I contacted them right before 9:00pm to let them know that my package had not arrived yet.The representative hesitated to assist, explaining that there is limited assistance available because everyone has already left for the day. She suggested waiting until 9:00pm for the package to be delivered. I requested her to wait for just 4 more minutes as the package, which was supposed to be delivered within two days, has already exceeded its expected delivery time. She helped reluctantly, mentioning that she would see if she could send a message to the dispatcher. After checking, she returned and informed me that she could leave a message for the dispatcher to call me the next day. However, she also mentioned that there was still a possibility that I might receive my package, as sometimes the drivers, who are supposed to return by 9:00 pm, may be late. It is now past 10:00 pm, and there is still no sign of the driver or any notification regarding my package.Multiple UPS representatives have consistently deceived me, preventing me from visiting their warehouse to collect the item unless I utilize their malfunctioning app, and seeking assistance from the representatives proved exceptionally difficult. Additionally, they provided conflicting information.Attempting to voice my complaint to manager Eric/Erik turned out to be disheartening as he outright expressed disinterest in addressing my concerns. He mentioned that he had already instructed the driver to reach out to me and provide a timeframe for the delivery of my package, assuring me that someone would contact me. However, despite the usage of their subpar app, which surprisingly worked on today, I witnessed on thevtravker in the app, the driver making other deliveries in my vicinity and then returning to the warehouse without reaching me. At 6:00, I saw the truck at the warehouse and this compelled me to contact their customer service!!

I'd also prefer if customer service didn't pause my chat before I have a chance to even speak with someone about my issue and honestly I wouldn't have as many issues if you guys would update my package location before you decide to delay the delivery one day before it's supposed to be delivered.

The customer service number they provide makes it next to impossible to speak with a live person (instead try 877-289-6418, but don’t expect them to help resolve issues) and when you are able to speak with someone, they only offer excuses, no resolutions or semblance of customer service (they don’t care, please stop trying to inconvenience them).

1,UPS - Customer Service Non Existent,"UPS may be just another example of a stale last-century American business that is unlikely to survive the next 50 years.  Like the United States Postal Service, UPS often comes across as a bureaucratic, stagnant, out-of-touch organization lacking innovation, and grasping desperately for profit by trampling their longtime clients with indifference. If chatting or texting with an incompetent robot is your idea of great customer service, UPS may be fine for you. If you expect to resolve issues quickly by actually speaking to a human…you should look elsewhere. There are other express shipping companies that still provide great “customer care”.","Apr 16, 2024",ups may another example stale american business unlikely survive next 50 year like united state postal service ups often come across bureaucratic stagnant organization lacking innovation grasping desperately profit trampling longtime client indifference chatting texting incompetent robot idea great customer service ups may fine expect resolve issue quickly actually speaking look elsewhere express shipping company still provide great customer care

2,Incorrect Delivery Estimate is My Fault?,"I got several notifications saying a package would be delivered between 2 and 6 and had to be signed for. They had links to sign online, but when I tried there were errors saying try again later. I tried probably ten times over three days, and it never worked. On the day of delivery I got an email at 9:30am saying they missed me as I was pulling into my driveway. I called support, explained the incorrect notifications and delivery time and site errors. They told me they'd have dispatch call within an hour. 4-5 hours later they finally called and was somewhat rude. They said they would call me back once they talked to the driver if I could meet him to get my package. No apology or acknowledgement of all the other issues. I asked what I could do about the site error and she said she didn't know but if I couldn't meet them they would try again in two days. So if you aren't following your own window, what am I supposed to do, take off and just wait at home all day? She called back later and said he wouldn't meet me but I could try to catch him and proceeded to give me the most vague descriptions of where he was, saying road names wrong, while she was talking to someone else, and I couldn't tell half the time if she was talking to me or the other person. She said she did that so I could see how it works. So I went to the first area and called her, and she said he's already left and gave me another area. I went there and finally caught him.

1,A Disastrous Experience with UPS,"I recently had an encounter with UPS that left me utterly disappointed and frustrated. I ordered a pair of running shoes from Saucony, who use UPS for their deliveries. My experience was far from smooth, and it was marred by a series of unfortunate events.Firstly, I received a notice that my package was delayed. While I understand that delays can happen, I received this notice twice without any explanation. When I reached out to inquire about the issue, the customer service representative was unable to provide a satisfactory answer. They assured me that I would be notified when the package was shipped, but no such notification came.To my surprise, I found a note in my post box stating that delivery was attempted but unsuccessful because I was not at home. I tried to reschedule the delivery using the “Info notice” number provided. Despite registering on their website, I was unable to make the changes due to constant website crashes. Calls to the hotline were of no help either.The second delivery attempt was also unsuccessful. Instead of sending the package to the nearest access point, they decided to send it back to Saucony. This decision, which seemed to lack any logical reasoning, was extremely upsetting.After another call to the hotline, they agreed to reroute the package to the nearest access point. I went to pick it up two days later, only to be told by the owner of the access point that my package had not arrived, despite the status indicating otherwise.This entire ordeal has been nothing short of a nightmare. The lack of clear communication, the unhelpful customer service, and the unreliable website have all contributed to a terrible customer experience. I am left with no choice but to avoid ordering from vendors that use UPS for their deliveries in the future.In conclusion, my experience with UPS was far from satisfactory. It was characterized by poor customer service, a lack of clear communication, and an unreliable website. I hope that my experience serves as a cautionary tale for others considering using UPS for their delivery needs.","Apr 15, 2024",recently encounter ups left utterly disappointed frustrated ordered pair running shoe saucony use ups delivery experience far smooth marred series unfortunate received notice package delayed understand delay happen received notice twice without explanation reached inquire issue customer service representative unable provide satisfactory answer assured would notified package shipped notification surprise found note post box stating delivery attempted unsuccessful home tried reschedule delivery using info notice number provided despite registering website unable make change due constant website crash call hotline help second delivery attempt also unsuccessful instead sending package nearest access point decided send back saucony decision seemed lack logical reasoning extremely another call hotline agreed reroute package nearest access point went pick two day later told owner access point package arrived despite status indicating entire ordeal nothing short nightmare lack clear communication unhelpful customer service unreliable website contributed terrible customer experience left choice avoid ordering vendor use ups delivery conclusion experience ups far satisfactory characterized poor customer service lack clear communication unreliable website hope experience serf cautionary tale others considering using ups delivery need

1,"I ordered a walking cane, but got an amazon bubble mailer with art","I ordered a package that was supposed to be delivered today. The image showed a flat item (like in a amazon mailer) when my package should've been at least 4 ft in length. The package I received was supposed to be delivered to a neighbor a few minutes away by car. I called UPS to let them know my package wasn't delivered and I'm in possession of someone else's item. They escalated the case multiple times and told me I would receive a call from a supervisor, but never did. Instead I got an email stating the driver's manifest showed it was delivered. I sent a photo of my neighbor's delivery and was told the driver would return to my residence to give me my delivery. I'm still waiting for the driver, but was given an estimated time frame of 5:30 and it is now 6:00. I will try to call UPS again, but I'm not confident I will get what I ordered back. I may have to try to sell whatever my neighbor ordered just to break even to try and get another walking cane. The tracking number for my neighbors package in my possession shows that it is yet to be delivered, so I'm not even sure how many things went wrong here.","Apr 11, 2024",ordered package supposed delivered today image showed flat item like amazon mailer package least 4 ft length package received supposed delivered neighbor minute away car called ups let know package delivered possession someone else item escalated case multiple time told would receive call supervisor never instead got email stating driver manifest showed delivered sent photo neighbor delivery told driver would return residence give delivery still waiting driver given estimated time frame try call ups confident get ordered back may try sell whatever neighbor ordered break even try get another walking cane tracking number neighbor package possession show yet delivered even sure many thing went wrong

1,UPS Canada charges even though they lost the package,"Here is a story you won’t believe. I ordered a book which was supposed to be sent by FedEx but was mistakenly sent by UPS.UPS sent us a bill and then a late fee. We did not receive any package. After 12 phone calls and over 14 hours on the phone, I found out that the investigation which was started 3 weeks ago had been cancelled. The shipment was sent 2.5 months ago and was lost by UPS. No one would admit to UPS losing the package. They then offered to start an investigation again. UPS says that we are responsible for customs and duty charges for a shipment which we did not receive. After asking to speak to a person who could remove our bill, I was told I could not speak to them. I was unable to speak to anyone in Canada. As of now, it is still unresolved. We still owe brokerage fees for a shipment which UPS lost in transit and UPS Canada believes that that is normal. I was told that it would be sent to a collection agent and then my credit score would be harmed until I spoke with someone who said that she would make sure that didn’t happen. I don’t believe that UPS had a safeguard to make sure that we are not sent to collection.UPS CANADA BELIEVES THAT YOU SHOULD BE CHARGED FOR DELIVERIES THAT THEY DO NOT MAKE!!!UPS CANADA DOES NOT BELIEVE IN CUSTOMER SERVICE.UPS CANADA IS A COMPANY THAT IS AMAZING AT BILLING AND REBILLING BUT ARE TERRIBLE AT DELIVERIES.THEY SHOULD BECOME A COLLECTION AGENCY.

2,"Dear UPS Management,","Dear UPS Management,I am writing to address a matter of urgent concern regarding the pick-up and delivery services provided by UPS, which are crucial to our operational success. The timeliness and reliability of your services directly influence our ability to meet our customers' expectations for prompt delivery.It has come to our attention that more than 70% of the reviews regarding UPS services are negative. This is a troubling statistic that underscores the immediate need for improvement. Such a significant percentage of unfavorable feedback not only reflects on UPS but also impacts the businesses that rely on your services.The essence of our reliance on UPS is the trust in your ability to deliver packages on time. Unfortunately, recent experiences suggest a disconnect between the service level promised and the service level provided. This inconsistency not only disrupts our operations but also affects our customer relationships and business reputation.We acknowledge the complexities involved in logistics and delivery services. However, the commitment to service excellence must be unwavering. It is essential that UPS addresses these service shortcomings promptly to restore confidence among its clients.Moreover, the importance of thorough and continuous training for UPS personnel cannot be overstated. Such training is crucial not only for enhancing service efficiency but also for ensuring that each team member can uphold and deliver the quality of service that UPS is known to represent.We urge UPS management to take decisive actions to review and enhance your service protocols and training programs. Addressing the concerns reflected in customer reviews and ensuring consistent, reliable service are critical steps toward maintaining and strengthening the trust businesses place in UPS.We are keen to witness and experience the improvements in UPS's service delivery.

I ring UPS customer service for the first of many times that week and they tell me there was an issue that it would be delivered on Tuesday as Monday was a bank holiday. Tuesday comes around, there’s no update on the app, I ring, explain the situation to them and they put in a note to the depot to ring me, then they tell me it will be delivered on Wednesday. Hear nothing from the depot and wait in again, same thing happens on Thursday. At this point I feel like maybe my package has been lost or something. Friday comes around, I ring and get told it wouldn’t be delivered until today. I decide to go out with a friend for food, get a phone call from the driver telling me he tried to deliver my package and couldn’t because I wasn’t at home. I tell him to leave it in with a friend who works close by and he says he will. He doesn’t, tells me my package will be delivered on Monday (which is today) get a phone call from UPS telling me my package was sent back to the sender and claimed that because I wasn’t home there was nothing they could do even though they’re the ones who messed me around for a whole week.

1,Where is my order,"""I ordered a package on Wednesday night and paid extra for two-day shipping. However, I was informed that my package won't arrive until Monday. To make matters worse, UPS has no idea where my package is, and they have only confirmed that a label was created. I contacted OWC to ask about the situation, and I was informed that paying extra for two-day shipping does not guarantee delivery within two days. also, they think the package is either still in the warehouse or UPS picked it up and hasn't updated their site yet again I ordered this on Wednesday night today is Friday. I know Ups delivers on Saturdays as well but how can Ups deliver something that they don't know where it is, I was already confused when I placed my order, but now I am extremely frustrated and angry. I am even considering asking for a refund because I work on Monday for school, and I won't be home when UPS comes to deliver the package. This only added to my confusion and frustration, as I had assumed that paying extra for expedited shipping would ensure that my package arrived on time. I am extremely dissatisfied with the customer service I received from OWC. The OWC representative I spoke with was unhelpful and did not offer any solutions. As a school employee who works on Mondays, I will not be home when UPS comes to deliver the package. This situation has left me extremely upset,  This entire experience is very upsetting, and I don't think I will shop at OWC again. Despite the affordable price of a M1 Mac mini 16GB for under $600, the poor customer service I received has left me with a negative impression of the company. I hope that OWC will take steps to improve their customer service in the future, as I don't believe I will be shopping with them again. nor will I be recommending them to others. It's very disappointing that a company with a reputation like OWC could fail to provide a positive experience. I would urge them to look into this issue and take the necessary steps to fix it. Ups is no off the hook either the automation call kept hanging up on me and I have no updated from them or how to reach UPS as well ups need to do better I would urge both companies to take immediate action to rectify the issue. They should also ensure that adequate customer service is in place and that customers can easily reach them. Finally, they should be held accountable for any unsatisfactory service.","Mar 29, 2024",ordered package wednesday night paid extra shipping however informed package wo arrive monday make matter worse ups idea package confirmed label created contacted owc ask situation informed paying extra shipping guarantee delivery within two day also think package either still warehouse ups picked updated site yet ordered wednesday night today friday know ups delivers saturday well ups deliver something know already confused placed order extremely frustrated angry even considering asking refund work monday school wo home ups come deliver package added confusion frustration assumed paying extra expedited shipping would ensure package arrived time extremely dissatisfied customer service received owc owc representative spoke unhelpful offer solution school employee work monday home ups come deliver package situation left extremely upset entire experience upsetting think shop owc despite affordable price m1 mac mini 16gb 600 poor customer service received left negative impression company hope owc take step improve customer service future believe shopping recommending others disappointing company reputation like owc could fail provide positive experience would urge look issue take necessary step fix ups hook either automation call kept hanging updated reach ups well ups need better would urge company take immediate action rectify issue also ensure adequate customer service place customer easily reach finally held accountable unsatisfactory service

1,A snail forced to carry my package through a salt flat is more dependable,"I have had trouble with UPS with this issue before but I have never said anything until now because it was annoying but I had no proof. Today I have proof and an eyewitness. UPS consistently will say that an attempt was made to deliver a package to my home, but they do not knock on my door. That's fair, I have a dog who is unleashed and likes to bark at delivery drivers. She is small but I understand some people are scared of dogs, so that's fine. Fed-Ex has gotten around this problem easily however. Their driver will either pull partially into my driveway or park on the road and honk their horn a few times and wait a minute or two for me to come out and get my package from them from the truck. Once again, I have no problem whatsoever doing this, as long as the driver doesn't mind seeing me in an oversized sweatshirt, sweatpants, a messy bun, and cat slippers. UPS on the other hand is absolutely deplorable. A snail with my package strapped to its shell and forced to crawl across 10 miles of salt flats would be more dependable than a UPS delivery. UPS will claim to have attempted to deliver a package to my home, but they will not come to the door to knock, they will not come partially onto my driveway, they will not honk their horn more than once (sometimes not at all) and they will not wait more than 15 seconds before they declare my package undeliverable and drive away. Today, not only did they do all of that, but my mother arrived home while they were ""attempting to deliver my package"" and they did not try and give it to her. She had to physically drive around them to pull into our driveway, and after she had exited her car and was standing COMPLETELY VISIBLY in the driver's line of sight, then UPS proceeded to declare my package undeliverable and drive away.

1,UPS  is full of empty promises.,I ordered a pkg from the USA. They delivered it to the incorrect address and sent me a picture of my pkg sitting on someone else's step. They charged me $87.12 for customs and duty.I contacted the seller who promptly reissued the pkg and sent again. When it crossed the border UPS  charged me $107.45  for an identical pkg without refunding my first payment for the lost pkg.After many calls to UPS I have never received  a refund. I opened an investigation which UPS  closed after 15 days. When I asked the reason for closing it they said because they had a picture of proof of delivery.  There proof shows my pkg sitting on someone else's step. Each time I called them they told me my refund was on the way. And the would confirm it with an email and the refund would come in the mail. That never happened.  They always had some pathetic excuse like they had filled there forms out incorrectly and the money would now be sent by mail. It never ever happened. This request for a refund has gone on with more than 20 calls to customer service and a promise each time that they were sending the refund within 24 hours. They never ever sent it.Finally  I contacted PayPal  to ask for a cashback on  the service I paid for but did not receive.,"Mar 26, 2024",ordered pkg usa delivered incorrect address sent picture pkg sitting someone else step charged custom contacted seller promptly reissued pkg sent crossed border ups charged identical pkg without refunding first payment lost many call ups never received refund opened investigation ups closed 15 day asked reason closing said picture proof delivery proof show pkg sitting someone else step time called told refund way would confirm email refund would come mail never happened always pathetic excuse like filled form incorrectly money would sent mail never ever happened request refund gone 20 call customer service promise time sending refund within 24 hour never ever sent contacted paypal ask cashback service paid receive

1,Horrible company,"Horrible company.  In the last two weeks we had two clearly damaged boxes delivered.  One speared by a fork truck and the other with shattered porcelain.  Looking at the tracking, both packages were handled by no less than 5 UPS locations in 4 states (all in east).   What adds insult to injury is they just dump the damaged boxes on the driveway without ringing the doorbell, even though MyUps has instructions to do so.  Furthermore, even after returning one of the boxes, UPS decides to ship it back to the originating location and then turn it around and redeliver it to me!  So that DAMAGED box will have travelled to no less than 20 UPS locations over its fateful journey.  This is just another clear example of leadership with heads in the clouds counting their egregious bonuses and just increasing prices to cover it all up for customers to eventually pay.

1,Today I declined a delivery of an…,"Today I declined a delivery of an outside television that I was eagerly awaiting.  Attempt was made yesterday, which I missed by 12 minutes.  As a single parent, it is difficult to determine when I will be around, so I attempted to call UPS to see if I could just meet them at the depot.  Something I had done years ago.  That is when my blood started to boil.  I was caught in a loop of automation.  The automated service kept asking me for my tracking number.  I repeated time over and over again.  It just would not understand my tracking number.  There was no way to get a live person available.  It was a nightmare.  I made mulitple calls, nothing changed.  Finally, I inputted probably 100 zero digits and a live person came on.  This person was on a script and would not deviate.  I was getting angrier by the minute.  My son by my side listening to me get upset at a stupid machine and then a human acting like a machine.  I wanted the product.  I did not want the aggravation.  I let them know but nothing came of UPS.  I then tried the company to find similar script response.  At that point I just told them to keep their product.  I emailed them probably 5 times telling the company the same thing.  I get a response at 11 at night via email.  Same response to multiple emails.  We have lost our customer service relying on automation.  Rather than keep the product that I so desperately wanted and waited for, I have decided to just go to my local electronic store and order there and pick it up when it arrives.  I will have to wait on the credit which was in the thousand before I can make the purchase.  But I make my point whether anyone cares or not.  By the way, the driver today was kind and apologetic.  Not his fault.  It is the company's motto that hurts the worker.  I have always treated my delivery people with mad respect, tipping the ones delivering big ticket items like my sauna and stuff.  Now I am on here to vent my anger to see that UPS has one star as its rating.  I would go less if I could.  I realize none of this will make a difference as one person, but maybe if it continues to happen, and others join in, they will listen and remember that human interaction is still the most valuable tool.  I have used it successfully at our practice, and our customers love us even 30 years later.","Mar 21, 2024",today declined delivery outside television eagerly awaiting attempt made yesterday missed 12 minute single parent difficult determine around attempted call ups see could meet depot something done year ago blood started boil caught loop automation automated service kept asking tracking number repeated time would understand tracking number way get live person available nightmare made mulitple call nothing changed finally inputted probably 100 zero digit live person came person script would deviate getting angrier minute son side listening get upset stupid machine human acting like machine wanted product want aggravation let know nothing came ups tried company find similar script response point told keep product emailed probably 5 time telling company thing get response 11 night via email response multiple email lost customer service relying automation rather keep product desperately wanted waited decided go local electronic store order pick arrives wait credit thousand make purchase make point whether anyone care way driver today kind apologetic fault company motto hurt worker always treated delivery people mad respect tipping one delivering big ticket item like sauna stuff vent anger see ups one star rating would go less could realize none make difference one person maybe continues happen others join listen remember human interaction still valuable tool used successfully practice customer love u even 30 year later

I don't understand how she is still in business. The very first time I met her before today, she scans my package and handed me with a receipt then tells me I will be billed for the price difference because my label doesn't match the box my item was placed in. When I asked her why didn't she tell me that before she scanned it, she said oh well and walked away. She laid the previous customers money on the counter so she won't have to touch him( black male) instead of putting it in his hand as his hand was extended to her to recv his change. I WILL let the whole world know how she conducts business and hopefully SHUT HER BUSINESS DOWN!!! Good Customer service has left the building and it should not be this way.

1,UPS always delays packages,"Threw my mom an 50th birthday party and ordered all my items from Amazon. Usually USPS delivers my items but lately they have been sent with UPS and they have delayed my packages every single time (it’s been in my city for those 3 delayed days) I made a UPS account and tried to get my items for pick up, can you BELIEVE you have to PAY A FEE to pick up an order that they FAILED to deliver?? I can’t get a refund for my orders because it’s “on the way”. Party has already passed so I have no use for these items. I cancelled my Amazon membership because of UPS horrible delivery. Amazon doesn’t care tho. Says I can get a refund on the 16th. Package got delayed again today til the 21st and now I have to wait longer lol it’s a joke. What happened to Amazon drivers??

1,Failed UPS Express delivery. Never again.,"UPS Express delivery was a complete disappointment. I had scheduled my entire day around receiving an urgent package, knowing full well that I needed to be present with identification for the delivery. However, there was no attempt by UPS to communicate with me whatsoever. Despite being at home with my cellphone beside me all morning, I received no message, call, or email regarding the delivery status. To my surprise, after checking the tracking information for the umpteenth time, I discovered that UPS had claimed I wasn't available for delivery and intended to redirect the package to a nearby UPS Access Point™. By the end of the day, it still hadn't arrived at this Access Point.This lack of communication and failed delivery attempt is unacceptable, especially for a time-sensitive package. Even after reaching out to customer support, I received no response. This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied with UPS Express service, and I have no intention of using their services again in the future.It's truly disappointing to see such a reputable company handle deliveries in such a careless and irresponsible manner.","Mar 18, 2024",ups express delivery complete disappointment scheduled entire day around receiving urgent package knowing full well needed present identification delivery however attempt ups communicate whatsoever despite home cellphone beside morning received message call email regarding delivery status surprise checking tracking information umpteenth time discovered ups claimed available delivery intended redirect package nearby ups access end day still arrived access lack communication failed delivery attempt unacceptable especially package even reaching customer support received response experience left deeply dissatisfied ups express service intention using service truly disappointing see reputable company handle delivery careless irresponsible manner
1,lost my package,I have a package to go back to Amazon but it seems ups lost it. The ups app and website indicates that the label was created but nothing else. This is the second package ups lost. I called and the automated assistant checked and said that an agent would not be able to help since there was no other information about this package. I'm out $31.99. The ups driver did not scan the label as soon as I gave it to him. This is the second package ups lost because I believe the driver did not immediately scan the label when I handed him the package. Had I known this I would have insisted he scan the package right then and there. I've been checking every day since and hope it will miraculously appear. Trying to put in a lost package claim is not as simple as it sounds. The last message I get is 'cannot submit claim your account number is not associated with your ups.com profile'.

We called UPS multiple times during the day and were even in direct contact with the driver, yet STILL the person ""couldn't find their way to our company's adress"", which very doubtful, because it is not hard to find at all - it is in the middle of our city's center, with a big sign on the door... It's really very simple to find! So the driver was either incompetent or too lazy to even try. I don't know which is worse. Fast forward to the end of the day and I PERSONALLY have to drive our equipment to a drop spot, despite having paid for UPS to pick it up at our adress. Was that the end of our trouble? NO!!!

1,What's happened to 'delivery' services,"UPS is either consistently incompetent, or deliberately ineffective. I guess I'm spoiled by Amazon, because they actually deliver.I ordered some products from Ontario, giving myself lots of time for them to get to Vancouver. One flight and 40 minutes drive in heavy traffic. The supplier sent them in a timely fashion and they were slated for delivery a week before I needed them (March 1st). Two days after scheduled delivery, I received an email from UPS saying that my package had been delivered. I was surprised because I hadn't seen it but didn't go back down to the lobby at that time to check the mailroom. An hour later I received another email from them saying I had 'Declined' the package. I checked my phone to see if anyone had even rung my buzzer, and they had not. I called them and they said they would set it up for delivery the following day. Nothing was delivered that, or the following day. The next day I received an email saying it was sent back to the shipper and, oh yay, I could track its route. That was the end of any hope for March 1st.After contacting the shipper, they agreed to send the order again. With UPS? I asked dubiously. Pity. But what were the odds something would go wrong again?Well, I received the email from UPS saying ""Sorry we missed you."" Then I went down to the mailroom and found the ""Sorry..."" doortag on my mailbox. Then I looked at my phone. No calls from the buzzer. So I'm not exactly sure what this means. Does UPS not deliver to apartments? Or do they not know that there are buzzers at the door to contact residents? Or are they not good at reading the part of the address that plainly says Buzzer 1234? Or, really, do they just do this to screw people around ? What could possibly be the excuse?But I guess I should be grateful I was finally able to pick it up today, March 17th.","Mar 18, 2024",ups either consistently incompetent deliberately ineffective guess spoiled amazon actually ordered product ontario giving lot time get vancouver one flight 40 minute drive heavy traffic supplier sent timely fashion slated delivery week needed march 1st two day scheduled delivery received email ups saying package delivered surprised seen go back lobby time check mailroom hour later received another email saying package checked phone see anyone even rung buzzer called said would set delivery following day nothing delivered following day next day received email saying sent back shipper oh yay could track route end hope march contacting shipper agreed send order ups asked dubiously pity odds something would go wrong well received email ups saying sorry missed went mailroom found sorry doortag mailbox looked phone call buzzer exactly sure mean ups deliver apartment know buzzer door contact resident good reading part address plainly say buzzer 1234 really screw people around could possibly excuse guess grateful finally able pick today march 17th

I managed to catch him the next time and asked about delivery instructions. He was rather aggressive with me but I thought things had been straightened out. I had sent several emails to UPS and been ignored, so I had reached out to the USPS letting them know about items in the mailbox. USPS must have contacted UPS because I got a call that I couldn't return, so I spent about an hour fighting with the bot thars won't let you speak to a human. I finally got a human and she had the supervisor call me. I told him I had spoken with the driver, all was good, don't write him up or discipline him ( I was trying to protect the driver, even though he didn't deserve it). Ok. Next driver ""knocked"" so softly I didn't hear him, and I was less than 2 feet away, but he did put my items in the door! Next delivery. Item came early, ok, HOWEVER, the driver came after dark, so my door was locked. Instead of having the sense to knock, he left my item on the sidewalk. His pic shows he didn't follow directions, or he would have knocked. Remember the supervisor said he'd update/correct my preferences. So not on,y did the driver ignore my instructions, he didn't knock, and the item was delivered after dark. I then spent several trusting calls to the UPS bot. I finally went to IM and was told I would ""definitely"" get a call by 1242 next day, CST. None came. I said I had romlewve but gave my email. No email. So I've been totally ignored and blown off.

1,The Decline of UPS,"So, I just got a notice and I was home all day and no one knocked on my door until my neighbor came to my door and knocked and I found the notice. I called corporate  and the 800# which should be renamed to call 1-877- call BOT! All phone numbers for help are transferred to the same program with the same bot, aka artificial intelligence and it is impossible to get a life human person to help and one would think. I remember that when UPS started they had live people to help us and now that they have prospered , yet the quality of service to its' customers, has plummeted to poor and very, I will add.  The link to track also on the notice, will also not work w/o your tracking no. At this now for an hour and hope this helps someone and UPS pays attention to their latest reviews and not just on here. The bot could not help me after spending 1/2 on phone. Pressing 0 no longer works. This shipment w/notice number only could have been any one package from multiple companies that I have order from recently. We used to be able to put the notice number and it would give us the information. I called my Local franchise UPS store and was advised to call and choose shipping rates and then put the notice number to get a live person but also she looked it up for me and gave me my tracking no. Why put us through more hardships UPS after you have become so successful! Fix this and make it easy for us to speak to a live person;  my heart goes out to the Elderly on this as well!!

1,Well I emailed UPS on their email…,"Well I emailed UPS on their email address (which they don't go out of their way to publicise!), and have had no response, so I assume that they probably don't care; something apparently reflected by the numerous other reviews here, so here is a slightly edited (for clarity) version of my email:As you (hopefully!) know, I received a package shipped to me from Spain to the UK.There were several problems with the delivery! Especially for a company that I believe ostensibly believes that it is 'international'?!First of all, I would really have liked a 'If no answer, please deliver to...' option. But no, only an alternate address. Why is this?Your 'Delivery Accommodations' is very US-language: In the UK, 'Delivery Options' would be much more recognisable.Your date formatting when showing current delivery-date (and, IIRC, preferred delivery-date) is (again) US-centric. You could at least format it to the locale of delivery, or at least display it in the less ambiguous day/month-name/year format e.g. 4 Feb[ruary] 2024!I was asked for my 'phone number, and your system doesn't seem to support UK mobile-format numbers (I tried with and without +44 and suppressed leading-zero). I didn't try a landline number since I don't have one (at least in the UK, this is becoming more prevalent). I ended up just putting in something that would allow it to pass!I arranged for delivery on a different date (though I would have preferred the 'If not answer...' option above). This was acknowledged, but it was then delivered on the original date anyway?!The shipping/package was marked as 'Requires signature' (so therefore I was obviously keen to ensure someone was in to sign for it, hence changing the delivery!) and it was marked as 'Signed by: LETTERBOX'!And then, to cap it all, your 'email' page (i.e. www DOT ups DOT com SLASH upsemail SLASH includeForm) doesn't seem to work correctly when I choose 'General' support category, there's no option to proceed! :o(And I couldn't write or even paste in all of the above text, which is why I'm emailing this address!>>> So, in summary, in the future, I'll be asking companies 'Who do you use to ship?', and if it's 'UPS', it'll be a 'No [way pedro]!' from me, and I'll shop elsewhere!:o(","Mar 9, 2024",well emailed ups email address go way publicise response assume probably care something apparently reflected numerous review slightly edited clarity version email hopefully know received package shipped spain several problem delivery especially company believe ostensibly belief first would really liked answer please deliver option alternate address accommodation uk option would much date formatting showing current iirc preferred could least format locale delivery least display less ambiguous format 4 feb ruary 2024 asked number system seem support uk number tried without suppressed try landline number since one least uk becoming prevalent ended putting something would allow pas arranged delivery different date though would preferred answer option acknowledged delivered original date anyway marked signature therefore obviously keen ensure someone sign hence changing delivery marked letterbox cap page www dot ups dot com slash upsemail slash includeform seem work correctly choose support category option proceed could write even paste text emailing address summary future asking company use ship way pedro shop elsewhere

1,THIEVES,"I made the mistake of using UPS again. I stopped previously as they add surprise surcharges on tubes.

They don't tell you which measurement is disputed, of course, just rob you for more money. As I don't trust them much, I photographed my parcel on a scale and with a tape measure next to it.

1,One Star is Generous,"One Star is generous. Today I received a message on my iphone that delivery had been attempted. I had been at home waiting all afternoon and I had received no indication that UPS was here. I phoned Customer Service. I got through after only three minutes wait -- so I guess that rates the one star I have to give. In any case, I told the rep that the directory buzzer on the apartment building rarely works and that delivery people have to phone me when they arrive. This has been accomplished successfully (several times) with Canada Post, FedEx, Amazon and Purolater. The rep said their drivers don't have a cell phone. I said ridiculous, everyone has a cell phone these days. He said they are not issued one by the company. The rep then suggested that tomorrow I watch for the delivery driver and get the parcel from him. Since this is an apartment, that would mean waiting in the lobby for up to four hours in case the driver arrived. I said no. The rep then asked me if I would be able to pick the package from from their facility. It turned out that facility is in a different city. I said no. The rep then suggested that I have  the package  delivered to a different location. Since my friend would be willing to accept packages for me, I said yes that would be fine. Then  the rep told me that there would be a fee charged for changing the address. At this point, I lost my temper. I cannot imagine being asked to pay a fee because their drive isn't able or willing to notify me when he is there. I said no and instructed them to return the package to the shipper. I will make other arrangements to retrieve it. I consider this appalling customer service and from now on, I will not order from businesses who are using UPS to deliver.","Mar 6, 2024",one star generous today received message iphone delivery attempted home waiting afternoon received indication ups phoned customer service got three minute wait guess rate one star give case told rep directory buzzer apartment building rarely work delivery people phone arrive accomplished successfully several time canada post fedex amazon purolater rep said driver cell phone said ridiculous everyone cell phone day said issued one company rep suggested tomorrow watch delivery driver get parcel since apartment would mean waiting lobby four hour case driver arrived said rep asked would able pick package facility turned facility different city said rep suggested package delivered different location since friend would willing accept package said yes would fine rep told would fee charged changing address point lost temper imagine asked pay fee drive able willing notify said instructed return package shipper make arrangement retrieve consider appalling customer service order business using ups deliver
1,UPS no longer delivers to home addresses.,"UPS no longer delivers to home addresses, however on their website they will state they have delivered to your ""residence"" when, in fact, they have taken your package to an unidentified ""access point"". If you are disabled, good luck getting your package. Although the phone reps are patiently sympathetic there is clearly very little they can do assist. I was also told 3 attempts on specific days were made, but not once did I get a call or email or doorbell ring and I was home all those days. Because I was unable to pick up my package at the access point, my parcel is now being returned to sender as ""undeliverable"". I am not sure why they consider themselves a courier service when they no longer deliver packages to the recipients' addresses.

1,Theft and Fraud,"Oh boy where to start. I would give UPS 0 stars if I could. Several months back I had sold expensive shoes and dropped them off at a local UPS Store location. They were immediately stolen, and done so before the package was marked “received” by the store. So after trying for hours to show proof of a drop receipt that matched the tracking number and date I was told that there was no way for them to verify if the package was received EVEN THOUGH I CLEARLY HAD A VALID DROP OFF RECEIPT. I lost hundreds of dollars instantly with no recourse. Some employee at that store definitely banked on the fact that the corporation has absolutely abysmal customer service and knew that I wouldn’t win any dispute I tried against them, even though I had 100% valid proof of dropping the package. UPS is like a toddler that did something bad - unwilling to take responsibility even though the proof is right there.Then months later I began receiving invoices for packages I never shipped, to addresses I have never seen in my life. Two of these were fraudulently charged to my card, forcing me to get on the phone with the bank and try to get my money back while changing cards to ensure whoever had my info couldn’t charge my account anymore. As to be expected UPS has no service or method of dealing with fraud, so now I have no idea if these fraudulent invoices will keep racking up late fees and/or affect my credit. Their customer service line doesn’t even let you speak with a real person, so I have no way of addressing this beyond filing a dispute which most likely will be denied, just like my lost package claims.This company is a dumpster fire. Don’t waste your time or risk your hard earned money dealing with this trash corporation. UPS employees will steal your stuff and fraudulently charge you hundreds of dollars with the tacit support of the company.","Mar 5, 2024",oh boy start would give ups 0 star could several month back sold expensive shoe dropped local ups store location immediately stolen done package marked received store trying hour show proof drop receipt matched tracking number date told way verify package received even though clearly valid drop receipt lost hundred dollar instantly recourse employee store definitely banked fact corporation absolutely abysmal customer service knew win dispute tried even though 100 valid proof dropping package ups like toddler something bad unwilling take responsibility even though proof right month later began receiving invoice package never shipped address never seen life two fraudulently charged card forcing get phone bank try get money back changing card ensure whoever info charge account anymore expected ups service method dealing fraud idea fraudulent invoice keep racking late fee affect credit customer service line even let speak real person way addressing beyond filing dispute likely denied like lost package company dumpster fire waste time risk hard earned money dealing trash corporation ups employee steal stuff fraudulently charge hundred dollar tacit support company

1,"Do not ship with UPS if you value your time, mental health, and money","While I have never left a negative review in my life, I feel the need to share about UPS.  I honestly do not know how they remain in business.  That is the honest truth.  The fact that they have 1 point something stars for reviews makes perfect sense based on how they operate business-wise.  I have had so many packages completely destroyed by UPS.  It shows that they have zero regard for trying to honour their customers and treat their packages with care and respect.  The crazy amount of effort it takes to get things like this resolved is also sadly very mind-boggling.  I have just given up on getting reimbursed on most packages of mine that were damaged.  One package I dealt with them on the phone, different departments, through email, etc. for probably 7 hours and I just gave up in the end and lost out on $500.  Their customs brokerage charges are also ridiculously high when crossing the border to Canada.  They will charge customs charges of $42 CAD on a shipment that is $110 USD.  In what world is it ok to charge somebody $42 for basically a paper shuffle on an item that is worth $110 USD?  When dealing with customer service on the phone, it is by far the worst and most frustrating company I have ever talked to on the phone, bar none.  I have literally given up on UPS, but the odd time people send me a package through UPS (without my knowing), more often than not it is a complete disaster (unless it is a very short shipment in distance).  Please, if you don't have to deal with UPS, do not ship with them.  UPS you need to get better on how you treat your packages.  Also please stop charging people crazily high customs charges.  You are losing many customers due to your very poor business practices.","Mar 3, 2024",never left negative review life feel need share ups honestly know remain business honest truth fact 1 point something star review make perfect sense based operate many package completely destroyed ups show zero regard trying honour customer treat package care respect crazy amount effort take get thing like resolved also sadly given getting reimbursed package mine damaged one package dealt phone different department email etc probably 7 hour gave end lost 500 custom brokerage charge also ridiculously high crossing border canada charge custom charge 42 cad shipment 110 usd world ok charge somebody 42 basically paper shuffle item worth 110 usd dealing customer service phone far worst frustrating company ever talked phone bar none literally given ups odd time people send package ups without knowing often complete disaster unless short shipment distance please deal ups ship ups need get better treat package also please stop charging people crazily high custom charge losing many customer due poor business practice

1,UPS don't care if you are sexually harassed in one of their drop off locations and think you should return to the store it happened in to report it instead of them.,"I went in to send off a UPS parcel around 3.20pm.

I was asked to enter my phone number on a device to send my parcel off and when I had done this I looked up and saw the person behind the counter pointing his phone camera at me. It was quite clear that he was saying things about me in another language and showing this person what I looked like/recording me. As soon as the person realised that I had noticed they quickly withdrew their phone. At the time I didn't feel comfortable enough to say anything as I was alone, but I have reported it to TVP and have tried to speak to UPS, who advised I go back to the store that it happened in to report this as they only drop off and pick up parcels from this location.

1,My most user unfriendly experience...EVER!!!,"My experience has been time consumming and over-the-top frustrating. All I wanted to do was change the delivery address for a package I'm receiving. Frustration#1_ Okay I need to download and install ""UPS My Choice"", I'm okay with installing the app and setting up the account if their system would let me. The fact that my email address and password were unique wasn't sufficent. I had to reenter info until I found a unique user name as well. Then I still wasn't successful at setting up the account because their system informed me that my street address was invalid. My street address is what it is!                  Frustration#2_ I called UPS Customer Service. The automated system kept telling me I was not providing a valid tracking#. After three attempts, rather than connecting me to a representative, the answering system said ""Please call back when you have a tracking number. Goodbye.""Next I called and stated I wanted to file a complaint. English was not the native language of the customer service representative I was connected to. I think I was told that the only way to change a delivery address was: 1. if the current delivery address was the same as the home address UPS has on file for me.     ""?""               I repeated this back to the rep to clarify if I understood this and she said that that was correct; OR  2. I could call the sender (in this case, Amazon) and ask them to contact UPS and change the delivery address. Recommendation for improvement:Make it easier for your customers to talk with a another human rather than a computer.Modify the ""My Choice"" app to allow customers to enter their address wheather your system thinks its valid or not. I was rather surprised when I entered 1946 Street name, town, and zip code and then have the UPS system tell me this was an invalid address.TEST YOUR SYSTEM before offending your customers with it!","Feb 28, 2024",experience time consumming frustrating wanted change delivery address package receiving frustration okay need download install ups choice okay installing app setting account system would let fact email address password unique sufficent reenter info found unique user name well still successful setting account system informed street address invalid street address frustration called ups customer service automated system kept telling providing valid tracking three attempt rather connecting representative answering system said please call back tracking number goodbye next called stated wanted file complaint english native language customer service representative connected think told way change delivery address current delivery address home address ups file repeated back rep clarify understood said correct could call sender case amazon ask contact ups change delivery address recommendation improvement make easier customer talk another human rather choice app allow customer enter address wheather system think valid rather surprised entered 1946 street name town zip code ups system tell invalid system offending customer

I opened up a claim on UPS and they always find a loophole, and turn it around and blame the Shipper, which is me.

I did that exactly how I have been told being told to ignore certain fields (I did fill the form while UPS person guiding me and double checked everything with them) Just to receive an email saying that the form is missing information  about what I have been told to ignore by UPS.3rd after many days and hours on phone with dozens of advisors who kept transferring me 100 times I finally got the duty to be paid as £221 while the goods only costed me £190 so they basically asking over 105% of the cost of the goods!! what an extortion and scam!4th  I immediately disputed this with them and have been told that they will call me in the morning to discuss the dispute.

We ordered a small package priced at R699, expecting a smooth delivery process. However, to our dismay, on January 23rd, UPS requested an additional R1219 payment from us. Since then, despite numerous calls to UPS, we have encountered nothing but delays and excuses.Each time we inquire about our package, we receive the same response: it's undergoing inspection, which supposedly takes five working days, and we're assured that we'll receive it by the following Monday. However, several Mondays have passed, and we're still stuck in the same frustrating cycle.It's evident that this company's service is deeply flawed, if not outright deceptive. We believe it's essential to warn others about our experience and urge them to avoid using this company altogether.

Furthermore, I have no idea where the money went, and my mother never even saw the phone I sent. They insisted that I remit the 200,000 Naira in exchange for the device's return to me in the United Kingdom. This represents the pinnacle of Wick.

1,DO NOT USE UPS,"DO NOT USE UPSI am posting this again because I still have not had a proper response, and I do not want my complaint to be buried by time.I bought a second-hand printed item from Europe, and the import was fraught with trouble. First UPS gave me no information about the delivery; then when I rang up I received inaccurate information from someone who did not understand what I was asking; then I received inaccurate information via the UPS website (which told me the package would be delivered on a certain date -- it was not -- then said it would be delivered the next day -- it was not). I requested more information by e-mail, twice, and finally received a call from someone who told me that the package had been held pending the payment of custom duties and a fee. This was the first I had heard of this. There should have been no duties on this item, as the import of printed matter is not taxable. UPS tried to extort this money from me, and also from the sender. At this point the sender requested the return of the item. This took a long time, but has now been achieved. I had further responses from customer services which showed that they did not understand what I was complaining about and, although they tried to get the customs charges waived, this failed and I continued to receive demands for payment, despite the printed item having now been returned to the sender (and sent to me quickly and without problems by another courier). Then UPS intimidated the sender until he paid the extortionate fee! I re-imbursed him, because none of this was his fault. It was down to UPS who bullied a bookseller into paying more than 200 Euros for customs charges which were not due, on a package which they did not deliver.

It was on the move from day one and I thought - excellent. However, it moved about 40 miles and then sat at one of their facilities going nowhere with no tracking updates for 3 days. It finally arrived twice in the UK on Monday. One arrival courtesy of a flight - the second? Who knows. Anyway, tracking estimated it would be delivered that day, Jan 29th. It wasn't. That then changed overnight to January 30th. Again... it wasn't. Now, their estimated delivery date is to be advised as I write with no explanation given.

1,Fed up with UPS’s lousy customer service and delays and changing my business account to FedEx asap!,"I order from Amazon frequently. When it ships via UPS my packages are delayed often. I can see it leaves and arrives at a UPS facility. Then I receive and email that says they can’t deliver because they need more information. However, when my package arrives there is no corrections to the label. No new label over the top and my complete address is correctly written on the label. If I try to call I never reach a person. The system that answers requests the tracking number, no matter how many times I repeat it or even call from a different phone it says it doesn’t understand. I even had someone else try with the same results. Very frustrating. I wish Amazon would switch to FedEx. I will be switching my business UPS as soon as possible.

1,UPS are LIARS,"UPS has failed to deliver my parcel 3 times now. each time they have come up with a new excuse. The first time, I left a note on my order stating they needed to call my phone when they are delivering so that I can come around the corner from where I work. Never got a call. Called the customer service and they said they never got the note. Asked to leave the note again and the customer service person said the driver should call me next time. 2nd time, no call again. This time I called and they said that drivers aren't allowed to make phone calls! Then, the customer service person recommended they deliver to a pickup location that was ""0.1 miles away"" from my house. The location he suggested was 35 miles away. I said no, just deliver to my house and call the flat with the intercom by the front door of the apartment complex. The next time, they failed to deliver again and the NEW excuse was that I had given them ""the wrong delivery address"". This is an inexcusable, blatant LIE as I had not changed the address one time since ordering and they'd already been here twice to ""attempt"" delivery so either they lied about trying to deliver the first two times or this excuse is just a lie. Now, their email asks me to update my address information, but when I go to do it, it states that I cannot update the address information for this order! The next delivery attempt is going to be tomorrow and i suspect they're going to fail to do it again.

1,Astonishingly Poor Service,"It is astonishing how poor the customer service from this mainstay has become since the pandemic.  It is practically impossible to reach a human though their convoluted automated system (I suspect this is intentional), and when you finally do, the agent can't help anyway, and usually there is a significant language barrier compounded by patchy international telecom connections.  Transit times have bumped up a day over the course of the past year or two, deliveries have been later in the day, and pickups have been super early or skipped.The drivers are (well-compensated) pros and the people at the local hub front desks and office stores are generally great to work with.  The rot is at the corporate level (as is traditional for megalithic institutions).Not once in many years have I had a damage claim approved, so we stopped paying for useless ripoff coverage for over-$99 shipments. There was a massive fraudulent charge to our account in June of 2023 and I am still chasing bill credits in January of 2024!  They continue to generate new return shipment charges and service fees for this KNOWN fraud.  The response from their billing and fraud departments has been very little and not satisfactory at all.  I am not convinced anyone has actually read any of my emails because all I get back are canned responses that dodge or ignore my inquiries.  I have invested hours upon hours doing frustrating accounting calculations for them, just trying to get our money back!After decades as a customer of UPS, we have permanently switched all inbound and outbound shipments to FedEx (unless the customer provides a UPS shipper number) and I highly recommend that all small businesses do the same.  FedEx has been responsive and proactive during the onboarding process, a stark contrast that proves it CAN BE DONE.  Deliveries and pickups are on time.

This instruct the drivers to deliver all items to the front porch. Lately all deliveries by UPS have been taken to the garage which is 75 feet away from the house. The driver had to drive past the house to get to the garage. the last straw for me was in December there was a delivery that needed to come to the house. Since the driver went past the house and took it to the garage, my husband tried to get his attention to let him know to bring it to the house. The driver thought it would be a good idea to cuss my husband out when he was asked to bring the package to the house. I have contacted UPS several times regarding the driver's behavior and twice after being told someone will contact me no one has as of today. Going forward if I order anything I have to verify who the carrier is going to be because i will never use UPS again. Unfortunately, there is a package coming today. When I checked on MyUPS I see where the delivery location has been changed to garage. No one in my family has requested and the shipper does not know I have a garage, so this is a flaw on UPS side which they are aware of it.

Why they allowed that horrible mess and depriving thousands of people without their valuable packages. I already received great delivery services from USPS and Fedex. I'm so proud of their CEO'S hard job and responsibility to direct and guide their company workers for doing an outstanding job performances. They're doing from unbelievable believable!

1,I wish I could give 0 stars,"I wish I could give 0 stars. There hasn't been a single instance when UPS delivered on time. Every time, they follow the same pattern: on the expected delivery date, nothing happens. The next day, you have to check the tracking page yourself, only to find that they claim an unsuccessful delivery attempt. After updating the address, it appears as if the delay is caused by the address change initiated by the customer. I've had deliveries to different addresses in the city center, and I'm confident that the sender provided the correct address and phone number. Their actions seem designed to conceal a high rate of delays and shift the blame onto the customer.Furthermore, UPS's behavior results in parcels being in transit for a week, even when the initial estimate was 1-2 days. For instance, if you place an order on Monday and the sender ships the parcel the next day, the UPS system indicates delivery on Thursday. However, following their typical pattern, nothing happens on Thursday. You contact them on Friday and hope your parcel arrives on Monday due to the weekend. Does that sound like a 2-day delivery?They could simply specify a 1-week delivery time from the start, but instead, they try to create the illusion of fast delivery, making their mediocre services appear more expensive. In my opinion, this is the worst international delivery company.

Well 1 month later I get a paper invoice that says I should ship them a cheque to pay the bill, and that late fees are accruing as of 2023-12-28, but I got the invoice 2024-01-12.

1,UPS is just the worst,"UPS is just the worst. I get deliveries to my house all the time, and they never arrive at the same time. Just in the last week, I've had (2) packages that require a signature. The first delivery was attempted on a Friday at 1:30. I wasn't home, and it had said it was supposed to be delivered Saturday for a week, otherwise I would have made arrangements to be home. They didn't attempt to deliver the next day, so I changed to be picked up at a local UPS store. When I got to the store (after receiving an email that my package was ready for pickup) they couldn't find it, and said it had never been there. The package was lost, and I couldn't file a report online, as it said I'd have to call the help line. The help line wouldn't allow me to file a report or speak to a representative, that wasn't a robot. Worse than that, it says my package was left at ""Residential"" (no address) and signed for by Lyon. There is no one by that name at my address, and the UPS store had no one by that name on thei payroll. I ended up having to contact the company I bought the product from, and luckily they were very helpful and got it all sorted with a replacement package. On to this week, when delivery was attempted on a Thursday, at 2PM, and another notice was left that they'd attempt today. So today I made arrangements to be home, expecting them to deliver at about the same time. I signed the notice, and left it on the door as instructed, but also put a note to call, with my number if I don't answer, stating that I am home. at about 2, I thought, ""oh this is the same time they attempted delivery yesterday, let me go hang out outside for a bit, just in case."" As I looked out the front window, I saw a UPS truck pulling away. I heard no knock, and there was no additional notice on the door. I grabbed my shoes and keys, and went to chase them down, because I can't afford to miss another day of work for their nonsense, but they'd already gotten out of sight, and I couldn't determine which direction they went. So now I'm sitting at home, getting up at every sound, in hopes that there are just (2) trucks that are routed through my neighborhood.","Jan 12, 2024",ups worst get delivery house time never arrive time last week 2 package require signature first delivery attempted friday home said supposed delivered saturday week otherwise would made arrangement home attempt deliver next day changed picked local ups store got store receiving email package ready pickup could find said never package lost could file report online said call help line help line would allow file report speak representative robot worse say package left residential address signed lyon one name address ups store one name thei payroll ended contact company bought product luckily helpful got sorted replacement package week delivery attempted thursday 2pm another notice left attempt today today made arrangement home expecting deliver time signed notice left door instructed also put note call number answer stating home 2 thought oh time attempted delivery yesterday let go hang outside bit case looked front window saw ups truck pulling away heard knock additional notice door grabbed shoe key went chase ca afford miss another day work nonsense already gotten sight could determine direction went sitting home getting every sound hope 2 truck routed neighborhood

From that day I lost track of it, tracking never updated anymore.And here is where the worst started, i called UPS assistance multiple times per day, in a single day I got the following answers:- your package will be delivered tomorrow (day 22)- your package was requested to be delivered on day 26th ( note that, day after christmas! like someone is working that day)- your package is 25kg and we don't deliver this kind of package, it is with bring.I got a call from someone (no idea who it was or from where) that explained to me that heavy packages are delivered from Bring and not from UPS.Note that at this point I had already received the other 2 packages, so a total of 3 packages of the same weight were already delivered.I asked how to contact this bring, they couldn't answer me.I understood that this was just a lie.I kept calling and calling, always different answers, I felt talking with someone who had this job since 2 days.Finally they open a claim for finding the package because it was not scanned since days; on day 27th I received an email explaining that they couldn't locate my package, and to write in details what was inside to open a refund claim.I sent them all the details as requested, didn't hear anything from them.On day 30th the package is getting scanned in mölndal again, I call AGAIN the support, at least 3 times, and get 3 different answers:- you just opened a claim so you have to wait 10 working days- someone gonna call you (didn't 't happen)- it will get delivered soonFrom this point, I get daily the message that it got scanned, and that's it, never attend a delivery.And now the comic part, yesterday I go check and it says that package is on the way BACK to the sender.guess what? I contact support that tells me they can't give out information due to privacy, when I'm the sender.Right now my package is in Denmark, heading back to Italy, where there is NONE at that address.I hope my parents can call the local UPS and get it for me from their warehouse, if not, this package will be delivered to an empty house.I'm upset, disappointed and disgusted for this service.I paid almost 150€ for 4 packages, this one contained all my clothes, I arrived in Sweden with only the clothes I was wearing, had to buy everything back.Customer service is made of incompetent people and drivers don't follow instructions, because I paid for floor delivery, while the driver left the last 2 packages OUTSIDE my building door, I had to carry 50kg on 2 floor stairs with no elevator.I'm fuming thinking I will have to ship another 2 or 3 packages in the next months that my parents are holding for me.worst experience ever.EDIT:9th January. package arrived in Italy, where none claimed. I received a mail from UPS saying that the day expired so it was shipped bad to sender. and now the funny part: because they didn't know my address in Sweden, and i didn't leave any email for phone number and poor them they couldn't get in touch with me.I CALLED 35 TIMES, LEFT MY PHONE NUMBER 35 TIMES, LEFT MY EMAIL 35 TIMES AND HAD TO CONFIRM MY ADDRESS ALL 35 TIMES. i fill up a complaint with all details, sender and receiver, even what was inside the package, item by item. And you f**king lie saying you didn't know how to contact me?F**king incompetent company, you all should just get fired and go pick up tomatoes, a more suitable job.

1,Clearing customs is so painful and stressful with UPS,"Clearing customs with this company is the most painful experience you will ever face. This is my fourth time ordering vapes from Czech republic. I now know all the information required for it to clear customs and had it ready to submit. I got the email from UPS asking for the information and ended up sending it to three different people over the course of yesterday. This morning I get a call from a staff member, requesting the information, as I apparently haven't submitted it. I checked my emails and can see I clearly did and even have a reply from the member of staff confirming they have received it. I have now submitted the information again. I then called customer service to put in a compliant, they transferred me to customs, customs then transferred me back to customer service. I asked to speak to a manager, manager refused (claimed to be busy). I tried to put in a compliant and request a refund or some compensation as this will now be the forth time my parcel is late (meant to be delivered by yesterday). But all she kept saying was ""we're really sorry about that, I will have customs contact you to get the additional information required for clearance"".

1,UPS Refuses to Deliver My Packages (Which I have delivered because I am handicapped and rarely leave the house) They Insist That I Pick Them Up At Their Warehouse,"Once again I’m getting a go round from UPS. This holiday season Amazon gave them some of my packages to deliver to me. Now I am elderly and handicapped and do not drive. I live in an apartment and get many of my essentials including food from Amazon who delivers to my door. I am home 99% of the time. UPS has a habit of pulling up in front of my building, then they send a text stating that my package is “undeliverable.” The first time that happened I went outside to the truck. The driver was sitting there, looked at me and drove away. They then sent a message stating that I could “pick up the package at their building.”  I called them and basically was refused delivery. So I told them to send the item back and was told that “there would be a fee of around $55 which is ridiculous for a $4 item! I informed them that I was “not going to go to their building. If I had transportation I would just go to drugstore to buy it.” It sat in their building for about six weeks until they decided to return it. This has happened a few times since and now I’m getting a run around regarding a package they have previously refused to deliver. Last night at eleven pm I actually received a text stating that they just tried to deliver my package (which has sat in their building for months) and nobody would receive it (at 11pm!) even though I am sitting here and know better. What is wrong with them? They have my number obviously and will text to tell me that they are “unable to deliver” but NEVER do they text to actually deliver! Why can’t they text or call and ask if I home and can I take my package? They are certainly a shady business! How do they make money with this attitude? I live in a nice respectable neighborhood and I have seen this attitude previously before I moved here when I lived in a house (also in a nice neighborhood).

1,Sadly the possibility to rate UPS lower…,"Sadly the possibility to rate UPS lower than 1 star isn't available otherwise I would rate them lower than the depths of hell, way way lower. Even sadder, this time isn't the first time they have let me down, I have used them only once, that was absolutely the last time.This time however it is a gift being sent to save my soul, a friend sent me coffee creamer as I have used my last teaspoon (I even tried scraping out the dregs) I cannot find it in France or at least where I am so have to have it sent to me.So, got the normal thanks for blah blah etc, here's your tracking number, I click on the number and start dutifully tracking, not before paying customs duty I hasten to add! The package arrives in France, it is positively zoomed down to our area, I was getting to be very impressed at this point, I'm even more excited the next day when UPS inform me the package is 'out for delivery' now then, I have to admit I did feel a little twinge of hope, could this be true? Delivery between 11am and 1330! I even gave the driver a little leeway, knowing that there were going to be a lot of deliveries I don't mind if he's going to be a little later, I am so excited, I could be drinking my coffee with my normal creamer in it....Fantastic, yet, in the recesses of my brain there is a little warning bell, there is also the 'voice of reason' (my husband) downstairs reminding me of past ups experience, but no, did I listen, no! I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt, even UPS can't get it wrong every time....can they! Anyway, back to tracking, I can even watch the little van on the map, every village and all the time getting nearer, Oh the excitement, one village away and I know how long that takes to get here, 10 minutes tops, so I patiently watch the little van, wait for him to drive into my garden, ooh, in 15 minutes I'll be drinking the nectar of the gods, Ooh he's getting closer,oh he's ..................parked in the picnic area 3 minutes from us, he's driven past the house, poor lad , he'll come by in a second, then I get the next message from UPS (yes, I know, I can hear you all screaming at how stupidly trusting I am) Delivery attempted................I don't think so mate, not on you Nelly, the little toad did't even stop for breath let alone the 1 meter from the road into our garden, the little toad drove straight past without even slowing down.This was going to be the highlight of my Christmas, it seriously was.So, I called the designated number to tell them to call him, I'll meet him outside, he has to drive past my house again to escape to whatever pit he came from, in the end the driver was contacted, the package is to be taken to one of their designated places, I can collect it from there.We practically run to the car, two confused dogs in tow and drive like madmen down the mountain to the drop off point only to find out it is closed.I am back home now, wet very sad and madder than hell itself. I called the next morning to make sure I can collect, no, sorry it hasn't been delivered yet, so the toad didn't bother ( quelle surprise) it's Christmas eve now, I have to call again today, I pray that they have had the decency to deliver but my heart is telling my head to be calm, I won't get my perfect coffee until after Christmas now.Christmas coffee will be ruined all because of a lazy f@@@@@ that wanted to get back to his depot.Would I recommend UPS?Not a chance, I would advise the very nice customer service people to look elsewhere for work, their blood pressure must be through the roof.Merry B@@@@y Christmas UPS and I hope all your batteries are flat.","Dec 24, 2023",sadly possibility rate ups lower 1 star available otherwise would rate lower depth hell way way lower even sadder time first time let used absolutely last time however gift sent save soul friend sent coffee creamer used last teaspoon even tried scraping dreg find france least sent got normal thanks blah blah etc tracking number click number start dutifully tracking paying custom duty hasten add package arrives france positively zoomed area getting impressed point even excited next day ups inform package delivery admit feel little twinge hope could true delivery 11am 1330 even gave driver little leeway knowing going lot delivery mind going little later excited could drinking coffee normal creamer fantastic yet recess brain little warning bell also reason husband downstairs reminding past ups experience listen thought give benefit doubt even ups ca get wrong every time anyway back tracking even watch little van map every village time getting nearer oh excitement one village away know long take get 10 minute top patiently watch little van wait drive garden ooh 15 minute drinking nectar god ooh getting closer oh parked picnic area 3 minute u driven past house poor lad come second get next message ups yes know hear screaming stupidly trusting delivery attempted think mate nelly little toad even stop breath let alone 1 meter road garden little toad drove straight past without even slowing going highlight christmas seriously called designated number tell call meet outside drive past house escape whatever pit came end driver contacted package taken one designated place collect practically run car two confused dog tow drive like madman mountain drop point find back home wet sad madder hell called next morning make sure collect sorry delivered yet toad bother quelle surprise christmas eve call today pray decency deliver heart telling head calm wo get perfect coffee christmas coffee ruined lazy f wanted get back recommend ups chance would advise nice customer service people look elsewhere work blood pressure must b christmas ups hope battery flat

1,You deserve a 0 and close your doors. Horrible!,"I would never give you a 1. More like a 0. How can a delivery service be so horrible with people's packages? First of all the package was with 4 others. Your driver stops to drop off 5 but because no one answered the door you couldn't leave the 5th? Your driver jumped out of his truck, dropped 4 packages,  knocks, runs back to his truck, before the door could be answered. My husband was 10 ft from the door. Driver was gone! You would have thought the package needed to be signed for. From there we wait until 6:30 to make sure he doesn't come back. Nope! He sure doesn't! I call the 1-800# to go through a horrible robot that really pisses you off. Got a call back from an operator. Tells me pretty much that your drivers suck. I Couldn't agree more!!! From there she has my information sent to the dispatcher for this delivery area. Call is supposed to come by the next morning. Reason for the call? Because operator #1 informs me my package will be delivered to a remote location.  ? Remote location my ass. My package stated my location. Not a location I needed to go find, because your driver is a dumbass. Ok so I get the call from the dispatcher.  Nice lady! She informs me my package indeed will be delivered to my intended delivery location and not the remote location.  Why? Because,  once again I am told their drivers suck . Yep, i agree once again. She also informs me  to put a note on the door, saying leave package here and sign it. Driver will have to leave package. We'll we did so on 2 doors. However, for 17 hours myself, my husband or my daughter sat right in front of the door watching for the delivery,  because no one was going to miss this driver this time. Come 8 pm when it said it would be delivered.  Guess what, nope. The delivery information now turns to running late but still on its way. Fast forward to 8 am this morning. 12 hrs after it was to be delivered.  I call yet again, to your 1-800 annoying robot. To get a callback. This conversation did not go well. Why because I now find out my package was at the remote location that I was assured it would not go to. Why? Who the hell knows. Maybe your dispatchers and operator's are liars, but unlikely.  More likely because their piece of crap bosses probably make them say ctap and pray for the best. Wait for the best part of this story. I then call the remote location and ask if they have my package.  Yes, yes they do. So now we get to take a trip and locate the remote location.  Here's the best part of the story.  I don't have to sign for any package and they now can't find my package either. Great job UPS it was my 5 yr old grandsons Christmas present. Never had an issue with FEDEX.  I will also guarantee you I will place another complaint with Amazon, as I demand my money back due to your lack of ability to delivery my packages.","Dec 24, 2023",would never give like delivery service horrible people package first package 4 others driver stop drop 5 one answered door could leave 5th driver jumped truck dropped 4 package knock run back truck door could answered husband 10 ft door driver gone would thought package needed signed wait make sure come back nope sure call go horrible robot really piss got call back operator tell pretty much driver suck could agree information sent dispatcher delivery area call supposed come next morning reason call operator 1 informs package delivered remote location remote location as package stated location location needed go find driver dumbass ok get call dispatcher nice lady informs package indeed delivered intended delivery location remote location told driver suck yep agree also informs put note door saying leave package sign driver leave package 2 door however 17 hour husband daughter sat right front door watching delivery one going miss driver time come 8 pm said would delivered guess nope delivery information turn running late still way fast forward 8 morning 12 hr delivered call yet annoying robot get callback conversation go well find package remote location assured would go hell know maybe dispatcher operator liar unlikely likely piece crap boss probably make say ctap pray best wait best part story call remote location ask package yes yes get take trip locate remote location best part story sign package ca find package either great job ups 5 yr old grandson christmas present never issue fedex also guarantee place another complaint amazon demand money back due lack ability delivery package
1,Christmas horror story,"I sent a box of candy from William Sonoma for  Christmas.  Somewhere along the line, two digits were cut off on the label with the suite number listed.  It read ""A1"" rather than correctly ""A103"".  The delivery address was a small shopping mall.  The package did have the name ""Petey's Grooming & Supply Store"" on the label.  Somehow the UP delivery person could not figure out where to deliver the package.  Last night I spent 1 1/2 hr trying to reach UPS Customer Service.  I finally spoke to someone I could barely understand.  I got the corrected suite number on the package and was told it would be delivered the next day.  NOT.  I called this morning and after waiting for another hour to speak with someone I was told that it would take 48 hours for the correction to be processed.  Alternatively, I could drive to Tempe, AZ, and pick it up myself!!!   In the end, I asked where the person I was speaking to was located ..... he answered the Philippines.  I'm sorry but I could barely understand this person.

The driver on Ring camera said there was no way to know when it would be out today. I signed up for updates on the website. Come today, again the only update is before 9pm. I was in the back room of my house and the driver came and ran the Ring doorbell. By the time I made it out front a few minutes later he was gone. Now my package will not be here before Christmas.

1,Warning to Shippers,"Warning to Shippers,  UPS is running a calculated Scam operation. You ship thru ship station. Owned by Stamps.com  You get your cost for the shipping through ship stations feed with the carriers. You pay and ship. UPS then at a later date , unknowingly to you, makes an adjustment (additional charge ) on to many shipments thru stamps.com and take the money right out of your bank account and there details of the adjustment are either completely untrue or phony or make no sense.  Now when you have many of these and you try to make a claim, they want you to fill out pages and pages of the claim form. Maybe 33 questions they ask , when all they need is the tracking number of the disputed shipment. That tracking number has every single drop of information they could ask for. Instead they purposely make it so tedious to make a claim for the amounts the extra amounts they take from you and it takes so long to fill out each claim that it cost you more to make the claims than to let them steal from you. They know this and they count on it.  There has been many class action suites against them for this with millions and millions of dollars awarded to the plaintiffs. But not enough to get them to stop this fraudulent practice because I believe that even with the lawsuits they make more doing  it even with paying millions.  the date of this started a long time ago after I switched my carrier from USPS to UPS.  USPS rarely charged a Adjustment Fee and when they did , they were normally correct but not UPS.    Now if you fraudulently and on purpose took money out of someones bank account what do you think would happen to you.","Dec 23, 2023",warning shipper ups running calculated scam operation ship thru ship station owned get cost shipping ship station feed carrier pay ship ups later date unknowingly make adjustment additional charge many shipment thru take money right bank account detail adjustment either completely untrue phony make sense many try make claim want fill page page claim form maybe 33 question ask need tracking number disputed shipment tracking number every single drop information could ask instead purposely make tedious make claim amount extra amount take take long fill claim cost make claim let steal know count many class action suite million million dollar awarded plaintiff enough get stop fraudulent practice believe even lawsuit make even paying million date started long time ago switched carrier usps ups usps rarely charged adjustment fee normally correct ups fraudulently purpose took money someone bank account think would happen
