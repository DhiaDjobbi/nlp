2,Where's My Stuff,Seems they can never deliver on time. Recently I tracked a Fed Ex truck to my building and yet a package was not delivered. Today I was given a specific delivery time between 11am - 1pm however at 1pm the delivery now reads By End of Day. A couple of years ago a driver drove off with my delivery and was under investigation by the end of the day having stolen a package valued at $800.,13 hours ago,US

1,Fed Ex remains the worse service ever,"Fed Ex remains the worse service ever. The driver leaves packages where ever they desire. By the side of the road,  blocking entrance to driveways and never follow written instructions as given. Obviously to their clients,  it consistently indicates a definite snafu.

Their advice is wrong, they cannot even quantify the charges, some of the more empathetic staff agreed that the situation was awful ""but there's nothing I can do.""Even the shipping centre I went to in the Caribbean told me to fill in a Commercial Invoice.

1,Just don't use them,"Fed ex is a useless courier, you can't even redirect a package and customer support just lie to you by saying they have actioned any problems you have.

And the worst part is that they didn't even bother to call or even inform me that a delivery attempt will be made even though it's a big box. Now, I'll just have my week ruined waiting at home for a delivery that I may never get.FedEx should probably get some resources to teach some of their delivery people how to read addresses.

My window has a view of my front door and the street.  The deliver driver did not even attempt to deliver the package for two days.

5,Package Forwarded Successfully; use web browser NOT app!,"On average, I've never had issues with FedEx.  Once or twice I might have seen a package kind of 'sit' in a loop before moving again, but thats the worst complaint I can think of.  No issues with rude delivery people, no issues with lost or extremely late deliveries. This is across three addresses over the course of 20+ years.Recently, I had an order where I failed to let the retailer know my new address.  I moved cities, 2 - 3 hours away by highway.  The retailer shipped to my old address and I freaked out.First I went to the FedEx app and was SOL.  The app had no options to deal with anything like this.  Rather than throw a baby tantrum and write a piss-poor review, I decided I should check the actual website.  Oh... wow.  You can do SO MUCH MORE via the website.  Without having to chat or talk to anyone, I was able to pay for a forwarding shipment and have the package re-routed to my new address.  Easy peasy.  Of course, because I am telling FedEx to fwd the package, it caused an additional day delay.  Package was forwarded with zero problems.  I am EXTREMELY relieved because otherwise, I would have had to take a day off from work to drive all the way back to try to intercept the package from my old address.All the complaints... I dont know, if you truly order a LOT like I do, you start to see taht ALL the companies (USPS, UPS, FedEx) have their moments of good and bad.  Teh amount of consistency we actually get from these companies in a line of business impacted by chaos and human factors is actually pretty good.But I get it.  Patience is a hard thing to keep when it comes to packages and deliveries.  It is what it is I guess.",3 days ago,US

1,FedEx has the worst work force.

1,Extremely shitty service,"Extremely shitty service. They won't let us choose a delivery window for free. Oka,y I understand it probably affects the route but at least deliver on the day you promised. I deliberately stayed at home all day and it said it would deliver between 9:45 and 11:45 am but it did not. It kept changing the time and in the end, just said end of day. Okay fine. I was at home all day and then the delivery person attempted a delivery at 9 pm. I was still at home. But I do not get any call or any doorbell ring. I even put up a note at the front door saying please call this number with my number but those useless people did not. Now it does not even let me keep the package on hold nor does it let me change it to pick it up from a nearby FedEx location. Very bad experience. Moreover, their entire customer service seems to be AI and voice assistant driven. I cant get hold of an actual human. It keeps cutting the calls automatically.",8 hours ago,US

Leslie goes above and beyond year after year and is just a wonderful person.  She is hard working, dependable and a huge asset to FedEx.  My dogs and I love seeing her come down our driveway.  She is always friendly and stocked up with dog treats.  She has a personal touch that is wonderful to see in today's world.  I can't say enough good things about her.

1,FedEx NEVER rings a doorbell,"Whenever I receive something by FedEx, the driver never even tries to ring the doorbell. Automatic ""failed delivery attempt"" messages, and they dare to say I was not at home when I clearly was. Today is no exception. The ""just leave it at the door"" permission also fails due to living on a 3rd floor.

And they only give me the form if I pay them first.So I have no choice to either pay them everything or let one package go back and still pay them part of the fees and of course more shipping costs.Completely useless employees who are involved in their scam.

Their exact words were, “You’re being ripped off.” That summed up my experience perfectly. RushMyPassport avoids no steps in the process, makes no guarantees, and ultimately serves no purpose other than taking your money; they also come recommended from FedEx, which is extremely unfortunate.To make matters worse, their refund policy is a red flag in itself.

1,Awful company!,"Awful company!! I live in an apartment building, have provided my buzz number not once, but TWICE. Even updated my address to include the buzz number. My parcels are always a week late. They are never expected when the company you order from, says they will arrive. I feel bad for leaving a bad review with the company I ordered from, but, as long as they use FedEx, it will always be a one star. I've complained twice but this has gotten me nowhere. Fedex SAYS they are delivering my parcel, but, they come back to the building just to stick a note on the door stating that I have to go pick it up. You were coming this way, anyways...I'm not sure why you can't just drop off my parcel. I had to wait an entire week to get my parcel, and the company advised only 3 days. I watched the tracking get bounced all over the place because they are too lazy to enter buzz codes or go into apartment buildings. If anyone is looking for a reliable courier service that has no problem delivering even to apartment buildings, choose DHL, Intelcom or Dragonfly. In addition, I have attempted to sign up for the Delivery Service Manager to avoid future issues, and there is an option for apt number and buzz code. I enter that info and press ""Save"", and then a notice comes up telling me that they can only deliver to residential areas and to please put in a residential address. Okay....so, why even add the option for buzz code and apartment number?",6 days ago,CA

1,FedEx sucks,FedEx sucks. It’s the worst. They scan packages as delivered when they are clearly not. When I contacted customer service they had the audacity to imply someone (a Walgreens employee) took the package. Had the package delivered to a FedEx pickup location (Walgreens). Received confirmation from FedEx and shipper that package was delivered. Went to try and pick it up at Walgreens and no package was there. When I asked FedEx for proof of delivery there was none. Very suspicious. I don’t believe a Walgreens employee took the package. Why would there be no proof of delivery. Maybe the FedEx driver scanned it as delivered and took the package since they want to be implying people taking packages. Just very suspicious. They take no accountability whatsoever and just say to contact the shipper. Luckily my shipper is a big company and made it right for me even though I feel they should make FedEx responsible. I love the company but hate that they use FedEx most of the time. I know I’m not the only one not getting my packages. I hope they stop using FedEx. They fxxx up 9/10 times and that is the reason for the review today. Plenty of opportunities for them to have shown improvement and they just didn’t.,6 days ago,US

I’m trying to convince the shipper to use a different Carrie because FedEx sucks 100% and according to the rest the mess reviews and Reddit and my own horrible experiences, FedEx needs to go out of business and leave the shipping game.

They take your money and then screw you with no consequences!  We needed to ship a package on Monday to get to the destination by Wednesday for a show. It was useless to even ship the item if it couldn't be there on time.  Shipping to arrive on Thursday was $14.58 but we paid $58.95 to make sure it was there by Wednesday.  They didn't deliver until Thursday, the item missed the show, cost us more revenue, but still charged us for Wednesday delivery and refuse to reimburse us for charging an outrageous amount for a service they didn't even provide. We weren't even asking for a full refund.  We were fine with paying the $14.58 for the service they actually provided even though I still could have shipped for less with other services if I wanted it there late! First and last time I will ship with them! They are all about taking your money but not providing the service you paid for and have no empathy for the distress they are causing customers. I looked it up and Frederick W. Smith (who founded FedEx) has a net worth of 6.2 BILLION in 2025!  He is stealing from people struggling to get by just to fill his pockets! Zero stars for caring about customer service! Wouldn't it be worth it to refund the extra money they charged me and keep future customers? They are going to lose way more money in the long run. I have no idea how this company has an A+ rating on BBB with 1 star. They are a real company but they are advertising fake services.

1,Unbelievably bad customer service.,"My package was to be delivered on January 22nd (tracking number436469310119) . I stayed home and sat 10 feet from my front door waiting from 7am because I am hard of hearing and have no doorbell. Around 2pm I looked outside and found a door tag. On my front door I had put a large note saying ""hard of hearing, please knock loudly"". There was no knock. I would have heard it, and so would my dog. So...I called Fedex to try and get the driver to return and got someone from somewhere in Asia who I could not understand. I then went online to have the package delivered to a local Fed Ex store the next day but it didn't get delivered and there was no update in the system. Here it is, two days later and still no package and no word from FedEx. I am beyond disgusted. I called the company I bought my item from (B&H Photo) and logged a complaint about Fed Ex, and I'm sure I wasn't the first. How a company in this day and age can be so sloppy, so insensitive to customers' needs and so unreliable is beyond me. I get packages from other shippers like UPS, USPS and Amazon and have never had a problem with them. Those shippers always give me a rough time frame for the deliver too so I don't have to sit by my front door all day. No such luck with Fed Ex.",7 days ago,US

1,Even a 1 star rating seems too high,"Even a 1 star rating seems too high, since FedEx provided me with the complete opposite of a service. I have paid for a next day delivery with FedEx to send a gift package to a close family friend. I followed their instructions and dropped off the parcel well in-advance of the required drop off time (11am). As I found from the tracking information later, the parcel wasn't picked up the same day, as the collection had somehow already taken place (10am instead of 1pm). This meant the parcel delivery would have been delayed by a day, which I could honestly live with. That's the last I have heard of my parcel. A week later and many days past the ""estimated delivery date"" without any updates, I took the initiative to query the shipment and navigate FedEx's incredibly inefficient website to contact support. After getting ignored for days, I finally find out that my parcel was actually destroyed and FedEx won't be covering any fees or providing compensation, as they don't cover anything made of glass. Needless to say, I am left confused as to why I paid FedEx to smash up my parcel when I was fully capable of doing so myself. Lesson learned, next time I need to take out some stress and obliterate a box of goods - I can do so myself and for free. In terms of sending important parcels - use an actual shipping provider.","Jan 23, 2025",GB

1,FedEx is terrible,"FedEx damaged our initial shipment but left a note saying we were not home so we did not know they had returned our package to the shipper. Eventually the shipper let us know of the damage and sent a replacement, sadly also via FedEx. FedEx continued to delay delivery and to say we were not home when we were. For days. Their web site does not show enough detail to know where the shipment is. I finally heard a FedEx truck going up the street and spoke to the driver who was very nice and helpful. She indicated that she did not have our package but that another truck might. FedEx did not enable her to check on where it might be though.She suggested I call 800-GoFedEx so I did. Their phone line is scratchy and nearly unintelligible. The robot offers useless choices, makes incorrect guesses as to what you need, and thankfully eventually and without warning connects a live agent.

1,Such a shame on what this company has become.,"So I generally don’t write these but have to share my experience with fed ex in the hope that they finally get it together. Most likely not, but, I’ll join the others leaving reviews. So had a package 2 weeks ago supposed to be delivered. Yep hit Twinsburg, immediately when to delayed and received 6 days later. Called and given excuses. Had a package supposed to come yesterday and was delivered to the wrong address. Called and started a claim and crickets since. Might I add, the pic of the delivery to the wrong house, the boxes were literally dumped in the yard and covered in snow. Have another that’s been coming, hit Richfield Ohio and immediately went from to be delivered to delayed and been sitting for 3 days with no update. Ya know, there was a time in the past when fed ex was the best. It was like oh paid a little extra but I can count on everything to run as it should. Unfortunately that’s not the case anymore and I will avoid Fed Ex at all costs. If I want to buy something and the only option is fed ex, then I will not buy that item or find something similar that will come by another carrier. Fed Ex is now the worst and I do hope karma comes around to them and their greed and lack of caring. We all work hard for the things we expect to be delivered on time and professionally but clearly Fed Ex does not care about the consumer at all.

Fedex requested the GAA form be completed to assist customs with clearing the box. Multiples calls and emails to Fedex Trade Networks Transport & Brokerage requesting the form. After 2 weeks Fedex finally sends the form. We send the signed form back over multiple days as Fedex claim they never received it only to find out the box has exhausted the time it can stay in customs. At no time did Fedex inform us of this expiry date. Fedex wasted valuable time by not sending that form from the beginning when we requested it. Now the box is being returned to the shipper. I paid a lot to have the box shipped from the US to Canada with Fedex only to have to do this again. Apparently the expiry date was Jan 17th and on Jan 18th I receive an email from Fedex stating  box has cleared customs and will be shipped to my family.

1,FedEx needs an overhaul,"I get a sick feeling in my stomach anytime I see that a package will be delivered to me by FedEx. In my town, they consistently deliver to the wrong address and the person there just keeps it. I’ve had to stand outside two days in a row to tell the driver that a package went next door to me. The idiot only relied on GPS while my house number is in big black letters on my porch and he still couldn’t get it right. The drivers just leave packages on the top step in plain sight or throw it when they could slide it to the right 6 inches to have it hidden from public but they leave it for all to see. UPS always delivers to the correct address and always slides our packages just out of sight from people driving or walking past our house. Their tracking is also much more accurate than FedEx tracking. It’ll say it’s due this day by a certain time when in fact, it’s 60 miles away at their warehouse. I’m thinking of not ordering anything from a business if FedEx is their carrier. They need to clean up their act by hiring more drivers who aren’t too stupid or lazy to use their eyes in addition to GPS, and who take more pride in the job they do. I’ve had to take packages to homes on the next block because they weren’t mine. Get it together, FedEx.","Jan 17, 2025",US
1,Never again: Fedex,"Less than 3 months ago, one of their Fedex Drivers made a delivery at a Home Address. After delivery, the driver exited the property and hit the custom mailbox in front. Major damage to the mailbox and also damage to the Fedex vehicle. This was captured on the Security camera. The driver did not stop and sped away. I was able to file a claim and Fedex did compensate for the damage to the property. However, the process took about 2 months to complete. Dont know if the driver was reprimanded or not. I should have filed a police report, but I assumed Fedex would resolve the issue. Now for the second issue. In December, I ordered a product from a Vendor of ours. Couple days later, i received tracking email from fedex that package was on vehicle and scheduled to arrive on 1/9. The product never arrived. Filed a claim with Fedex. They asked me to send them Order information, cost, receipts, etc. Subsequently, Fedex provided no updates on the claim until today (over 4 weeks). Fedex response: Sorry, we cant find the shipment. Contact your shipper. I had already contacted the shipper and they are sending replacement. However, Fedex doesnt say ""We are sorry, We screwed up."" They just say contact your shipper. As for me, I will never ship with Fedex again. Because their lack of customer empathy and unresponsiveness, I have also authorized the company I own to stop using Fedex. I would not want my customers to be subjected to a company who has lost customer focus.","Jan 20, 2025",US

I spoke with Marcus after him assuring me that he was going to personally handle and issue only to find out my package never made it to it's destination. My Aunt was being honored at an event she is 98 years of age. I designed some legacy hoodies for them to wear a total of 7 for the main ppl attending the event for Amtrek retirees and family. The event is later today. I paid basically 40.00 for the package two day express. and you failed. The package arrived in Ocala at 10:28 and no one can explain how I had to call at 6 pm only to find the package was delayed yet no one can tell me why. It further infuriates me that the Escalations manage assured me he was handling it himself and the package would make it to my aunt's house before they leave but each time i reached out there was no response as he told me he would contact me with in the hour nothing. I thought your company was better than the rest. Here however is my expectations I will not and I MEAN WILL NOT BE CHARGED FOR THE MESS YOU HAVE MADE. I DEMAND MY PACKAGE GET TO THE HOUSE THIS MORNING BEFORE 9 AM IF THE OWN OR MANAGER OF FEDEX IN OCALA HAS TO DRIVE IT HIMSELF. IF THAT CANT BE DONE PLEASE ADVISE AND I WILL HAVE MY COUSIN DRAG MY AUNT 98 YEARS OF AGE OUT TO YOUR STORE BEFORE THEY PREPARE TO LEAVE ON THIS TRIP TO DO YOUR JOB AND PICK UP THE PACKAGE.

1,Extreme dishonesty regarding an ordered item.,I used to think that FEDEX had a reasonably good delivery service. Not any more!! I ordered an electricscooter thru Walmart.com. The shipment was supposed to come via FEDEX. Supposedly the item was out for delivery on Friday 1/17/25. Supposedly they attempted delivery that day and I was not home.But there was no FEDEX sticker on my door verifyinga delivery attempt. Then supposedly a driver namedMelissa was going to deliver on Saturday 1/18/25.At one time I actually saw an internet entry saying theyhad delivered very late at the front door. I looked and did not see it. I looked at all the other apartments in my area to see if they delivered to the wrong apartment. I saw nothing. Because this shipment came from the greater Los Angeles area I would have believed them if they said the nearby wildfires had damaged some parcels. Another possibility is a dishonest employee with FEDEX who stole the parcel.Here is another act of extreme dishonesty: When I wentdirectly to the FEDEX website to file a complaint directly with FEDEX I found out they had scrubbed the tracking number of this ill-fated shipment so I couldn't file a complaint directly with FEDEX.UPDATE on 1/20/2025. I made a trip way off to San Angelo FEDEX at the airport located on the extreme outskirts of town. Only one problem got resolved. Their automated system now recognizes the tracking number which it didn't before. I was told that another FEDEX location way off on the opposite extreme outskirts of town was handling home deliveries.One thing we need in this country is a federal law to force businesses to stop cutting corners on customer service and to stop thinking that artificial intelligence can somehow remove the need for customer service employees. It doesn't work.,"Updated Jan 20, 2025",US

While the first delivery went smoothly—thanks to the driver calling me twice ahead of time, allowing me to meet him outside and receive the package—the second delivery has been highly disappointing.Despite being home at the scheduled delivery time, I received an email notification stating that the delivery had failed because I was not present. Strangely, the driver managed to leave a failed delivery note in my postal box but did not consider placing the package inside it, which would have been a reasonable solution.Following this incident, I contacted your online customer service, and they assured me that the package would be delivered the following day directly to my postal box. However, once again, I received a notification of failed delivery, even though I was at home at the time. To make matters worse, several days have passed, and I have yet to receive any further updates or confirmation on the status of my package.This experience has been frustrating and highly inconvenient. As a customer, I expect a reliable and efficient service, and unfortunately, this situation has left me extremely disappointed. I kindly request an immediate resolution to this issue and expect clear communication regarding when I can expect to receive my package.Due to this experience, I will reconsider using your services in the future and will not be recommending them to others. I hope this matter is taken seriously, and appropriate measures are implemented to prevent similar occurrences for future customers.I look forward to your prompt response and resolution.Sincerely,L.duplessis","Jan 20, 2025",NL

1,Custom Clearance Payment Rort,"They sent me an initial bill for custom clearance of a package which had an attached total amount payable which was different to the total amount payable stated in the body of the email. The email contained a payment link I clicked on which took payment for a different amount, which I paid. These payments all got incrementally higher with my paying the higher amount using their BPay link. Then they emailed me to say I owed more money described as a 'shortfall' payment. I was then told by customer service that their only method of payment (BPay) charged an additional surcharge on top of their total amount payable which they had not disclosed previously in their payment requests. So yes I was told 4 different total amounts payable. Each total amount payable was more expensive than the last - with the only explanation being 'exchange rate changes' despite my paying in full on the same day as they sent the initial bill. It's worth mentioning I have imported items from overseas many times with other delivery companies in the past and never had this experience before, I've always been sent one bill for one amount and paid it with no issues.

1,Terrible service delivery + rude customer service = PREMIUM DISASTER!,"I wish a rating of no stars was possible so that I could give it to FedEx. After forcefully paying a premium for overnight delivery, it makes me livid to be treated as poorly as I have been by them.My package, coming from Washington to Atlanta and containing sensitive documents, keeps being serially delayed without explanation. All I see through tracking is that it is in Maryland one day or Tennessee the next. Then I get email updates only after the previous deadline, informing me that the package would be delivered the next day ""BEFORE 8 PM AND REQUIRES A SIGNATURE."" They conveniently do not provide a customer service email address on their site. You have to call or use the chat service, which wastes many minutes with AI agents that aren't even helpful.The straw that broke the camel's back was receiving a voicemail from one of the male service personnel stating that the nature of my delivery address means I have a 48-hour window to pick up the package myself at their service station, which is so far away, in the middle of the week, or they will return the package to the shipper! This same guy, who didn't mention his name, was also extremely rude on the phone with my friend, who shares the same address, and scheduled her package to be returned to the shipper immediately after the unpleasant call WITHOUT her authorization. It's truly ludicrous.For a global courier service of its stature, my utter disappointment with FedEx's incompetence and lack of customer support doesn't even begin to describe my irritation. All I can advise anyone when they hear this company's name is to RUN!!!!! There's no way I'm dealing with them after this encounter. UPS and all others are so much better.UPDATE from 2 days ago - I had to go to their facility for the pick up as that was the only option they provided despite editing the delivery address to a convenient residential address on their website as customer service initially suggested.

The item weighed 88 pounds but the box was a large square Fedex box and I paid all the extra to be sure it was covered.  I have shipped hundreds of items using mostly USPS and UPS and the least Fedex because of cost.  But for this special item I was proud to have sold I decided to use Fedex because I was wrongly led to believe it was the best probably because it is most expensive.   It was boxed up great with 4 boards across the bottom and plenty of cusioning between item and the box as after shipping hundreeds .  I labeled it Fragile all over and marked withHeavy stickers. The proper orientation with up arrows and top and bottom written as well.  The delivery was left after signing on its side the buyer said.  After inspection the buyer sent pictures showing the damage taken from delivery.  There is a metel door that screws go into to mount door and they were broken clean off and the screws were bent.  Clearly, the box had been dropped or hit with more than standard moving force, that is for sure.  I filed a claim with Fedex and it was denied twice.  I submitted everything they asked and they just say, "" it wasnt packaged proper.  Why would I go out of my way to do all I did to prepare the box improperly.  Clearly, it was a hard jolt that did it.  I even had shock/jar sensors on the item and box and both were definately positive for that abuse.  Fedex has gone down the toilet if you value what you ship with them.  if the item is unbreakable then your chances may rise some.

You're frigging FED EX, of course you have an overwhelming number of packages. The package was sent and paid for 2 day delivery and it's been almost a week. When I buy a pack of gum, I give the money for the pack of gum and I get the pack of gum, I don't get it a week later. WTF is wrong with FedEx?I also tried to escalate past the Manager and the manager says that she can't escalate past her. This is the best we can do, is what she says. I tried to report the package stolen and the Manager refused and said the package has to be missing for 7 days. Fed Ex is the worse company for sending packages.

When you call to ask what is happening, depending on which way the wind blows, some people say it isn't on stop and others say it is on stop. What they can't tell me is why it is on stop. They think it is an alleged debt but all invoices are paid and up to date. Alleged debt has been passed to a collections team but FedEx can't tell me who or how to speak to them. We must ""wait and see"" if the collections team contact us. As the alleged debt has been moved to someone else, apparently all the invoices and details are removed from the FedEx system so no one can tell me specifically which alleged invoice is unpaid. It's been over a week with no resolution. I've requested our account manager to call us, no response. I've requested for ANY manager to call us, no response.

I spent the whole day waiting for the delivery, just to receive the ""sorry we missed you, no one was a home"" notification, when 2 minutes prior to this, I had received an ""out for delivery"" notification. The delivery depot is about an hour away. After contacting customer support, I was told it was my fault no one was there to pick up the delivery, but once I pointed out it's physically impossible to travel said 40 miles in the 3 minutes between the above notifications, it suddenly turned out it was the courier's fault. Not to mention that the live-chat sent me to talk to them on the phone and the customer service operator told me use the live-chat and hung up.

1,Last strike,"Rant uploading concerning FedEx  and Chewy !!!I promise that I am not exaggerating at all when I say that in the many adult years I have lived at this home, probably 50% of the Fedex deliveries that we have expected have arrived at the correct address and in an acceptable location. I cringe every time I see that something is being sent through fedex. We had Factor for a while and they send boxes weekly. Not one ever was delivered to our house. We have had Chewy deliveries at three different neighbors and a few just thrown out in the open yard while raining without even a bag. I made a Chewy order a few days ago. Weather was moving in so it didn't surprise me that the Saturday delivery was delayed. No harm done. Sunday is Sunday. Didn't expect a Sunday delivery. Monday came around. I had scraped the driveway Saturday afternoon so with the sunshine could warm it all day Sunday. Before 7:00 this morning, my neighbor had left safely in a two wheel drive pickup truck. Soon after, my husband left for work in his car. Within a hour, a Hiller van was here for our seasonal maintenance. He made it up here just fine and even turned around and left safely all before the temps got above freezing. Hours and hours later... after sun and melting... and I mean close to 4:00 p.m., I got a notification that Fedex had delivered our package, but no one had been up to the house. I check into it further and see the delivery photo shows my unprotected, water absorbent, cardboard box full of my husband's hard earned money is sitting in a pool of snow melt by a very, public very busy highway during rush hour. Thankfully I was home so I was able to drive down in my truck to pick it up before it got totally ruined. I had to take my truck because I am not, at the moment, able to physically carry a fourty pound box up my hill. There was nothing NOTHING impassable or dangerous about my driveway. I took a photo when I got down there to show its condition. If a two wheel drive truck can make it up my driveway, Fedex can. If a car can make it up my driveway without the tiniest slip, Fedex can. Best shame ever on Fedex is that within half a hour of their ""delivery"", a USPS vehicle made it all the way up my driveway and left a package safely in the dry under my carport and I didn't find them in the ditch either. USPS!!!! They consider my mailbox ""undeliverable"" when there is a tiny hump of snow in front of it from the snow plows.... that I also hate, but that rant is for another day. Fedex needs to do something about their drivers. Today's delivery was a horrible advertisement for Fedex. I guarantee a minimum of 100 drivers drove past while their branded box truck sat in a completely clear driveway and the driver sat my box in the waterlogged grass then stepped back to take his photo to prove of his ineptitude. Chewy, we have never had an issue with your service. Fedex is loosing you money if they are anything like this outside of Knoxville. Lost packages, damaged packages, etc. If I was a less honest person, I could easily say the food was ruined while sitting in the water by the roadside. I could even say it was missing because it was not left on my porch or by the door where instructed. The lazy and disrespectful behavior of today's driver is the last strike. I will never use Fedex ever again for a shipment of anything if I have a say about it.","Jan 14, 2025",US

1,My experience with FedEx,"My experience with FedEx: I am a member of a wine club. Incident on: I purchased three cases of wine that was to be delivered by FedEx. The driver came to my door and after I had signed for the wine he went to the truck, pull the cases out one by one, and placed them on the road pavement immediately behind the truck. 2: I purchased another case of wine from the same wine club and again they chose FedEx to do the delivery. The delivery was for the 19th of December and required an adult signature. I had an appointment so I asked my wife to keep a lookout for it. When I got home and asked her about the wine she said no one had come by. I looked at the tracking and it said that there was an attempt to deliver the wine but no one was here to sign for it and they would try again the next day. I stayed home the 20th to be available to provide a signature. No delivery. When I checked the tracking, it was not updated. I tried getting in touch with FedEx but no luck there either. I called the wine company and they agreed to send me another case as it appeared the first case was lost by FedEx. 3: the replacement case was in its way along with another case I had purchased. I received tracking that said it would be here today the 12of December. I had a family event to go to so I went to delivery manager o. The app andPaid 5.50 each case to have the delivery date moved to Monday the 13th. I received an email shortly afterwards saying, again that the deliver would be made today ,not tomorrow like I had requested and paid for. So I called and although I could not reach a live person, I was able to move my shipment of two cases to pickup at a store near me as opposed to it being delivered while I was at the family event. I am at the family event and my doorbell notifies me that someone is at the door. I look at the doorbell app and I see the FedEx man. I talk with him through my doorbell and he agrees to come back tomorrow. Not happy and would never use FedEx unless I absolutely have to.

When the truck drove right by our house, I called only to be told it had NOT made the truck.  GrrrrrrrThis happens with EVERY delivery but most annoying is wine that requires a signature.  They tell us it is scheduled for Tues (we used to sit and wait for it) and then, late in the day, we get an update it will come tomorrow.  If we.believed anything we get from FedEx, we would be sitting at home for 2 days hoping for a delivery. BI am going to start requesting delivery by UPS.

Tracking information frequently ""unavailable at this time"". Tracking info indicates the parcel is apparently in Memphis, TN but the customer support person says that's just where it was ""scanned"", it's actually in the UK. The company in an absolute farce.

1,Poor Customer Service,"I truly hate to give a 1-star review as I generally don't have any issues with the drivers, but what really irritates me is their customer service line.  You can't ever get through to the local terminal.  No matter if you're trying to reach freight or small package, you can verify that you have the correct phone number but whoever answers the phone always makes it appear that you called the wrong one and they have to transfer you.  And then whoever you have to talk to doesn't speak the best English so after the frustration of getting through to someone, you can't hardly understand them.  I question if they're even here in the states.  Probably not.   Which I realize FedEx is a global company, but if I'm calling from here in the states, I don't want to speak with someone overseas.  And because they are not local, they are unable to lookup anything unless you have the reference number.  So, I schedule a pickup, expecting them to hold up their part.  I have to leave work and then my team is informing me that FedEx didn't make it in.  So, I call FedEx Freight Customer Service.  The woman asks if it's ground or express.  I tell her it was LTL, and she has to transfer me.  Then they want to be rude because I don't have the confirmation number, and they refuse to look it up by pickup location (company name and address). I guess it's too much to ask that vendors do their job which they are hired for.  And because they are so big, they can do whatever they want and get away with it.  I see they are rated bad on here, but it doesn't matter.  They are still a giant in the industry and have been for many years.","Jan 10, 2025",US

We're able to see each other and talk on our phones securely via the app recording our interaction.  If necessary, I tell him where to put the item (in a nearby more-concealed area) and sign for it on my phone.FedEx would be liability-covered by the recorded conversation that includes a photo or video of the item placed according to my instructions.You’re welcome FedEx.

So, if you ever have a package delivered to another address, don’t expect to get it, and pray that you don’t have anything of significant value in it. They have no urgency, let alone concern, for retrieving your package, even when consistently receiving follow-ups from the individual who received the package by mistake.I’ve also had several poor experiences with drivers and, possibly, other employees in the dispatch/distribution process mishandling packages.

1,Frustration with FedEx’s Disorganized and Unreliable Service,"I’m writing to express my frustration with the disorganized and unreliable service I received from FedEx. Below is the timeline of events for my shipment from Hallmark:Friday, January 3, 2025•	3:00 PM: Shipment information sent to FedEx.•	5:37 PM: Package picked up in Concord, NC.•	5:39 PM: Shipment marked as ""arriving early.""•	8:40 PM: Package left FedEx origin facility in Concord, NC.•	10:49 PM: Arrived at FedEx hub in Memphis, TN.Saturday, January 4, 2025•	3:42 AM: Departed FedEx hub in Memphis, TN.•	7:58 AM: Arrived at destination sort facility in Honolulu, HI.Tuesday, January 7, 2025•	10:27 AM: Marked as ""At local FedEx facility"" in Honolulu, HI (twice).•	10:28 AM: Updated to ""Shipment arriving On-Time.""•	10:36 AM: Marked as ""On FedEx vehicle for delivery.""Despite receiving a text stating that the package was out for delivery, it did not arrive as promised. This lack of clarity and cohesion in communication has been incredibly frustrating.I did not bother contacting FedEx customer service this time because, based on prior experience, they are unhelpful. They consistently claim shipments are ""on time,"" even when they are clearly not. In a previous issue, I was told that an email I received about my shipment was a scam. However, this explanation made no sense as the tracking number matched Hallmark’s records exactly. Why call again when they won’t take meaningful action?I want to emphasize that Hallmark is not at fault in this situation. If I had known they used FedEx as their shipping provider, I would have never placed an online order. My frustration lies entirely with FedEx’s inability to deliver on its promises. This experience has made me reconsider purchasing from companies reliant on their services.To anyone considering using FedEx: think twice. The experience is far from seamless, and customer service is unhelpful.STAY AWAY FROM FEDEX.","Jan 8, 2025",US

They can’t get into my building, but never alerted me on the app they were delivering at that moment. They did however, sent a message on the app that they couldn’t deliver and left. This went on for two weeks. I called customer support three or four times. Nothing. I also could not get the 17 dollar fee to expedite refunded I will never trust this company again.

1,FedEx: The Unstoppable Champion of Delays and Disappointment,"Professional Review: FedEx Macon and Ellenwood Warehouses – A Nationwide Crisis of AccountabilityI am writing this review to express my profound disappointment with FedEx, specifically the Macon and Ellenwood warehouse locations. My experiences with these facilities, coupled with countless negative reviews spanning nearly a decade, reveal a troubling pattern of systemic issues that plague the company on a nationwide level.Packages are consistently delayed or remain inexplicably “stuck” at these facilities for days, sometimes weeks. Despite making numerous calls to the 1-800 number and speaking with supervisors, the response has been a frustrating cycle of empty promises and scripted reassurances. Support tickets are filed, and bold statements like “your package will be delivered by the end of the day” or “I will personally update you” are made, only for none of these commitments to be honored.The deeper I dig, the more I realize this isn’t an isolated issue. After reading hundreds of reviews across various websites, it’s clear that FedEx facilities nationwide are grappling with the same problems: extreme delays, lost packages, and a complete lack of accountability. The Ellenwood location, much like Macon, exemplifies these failures, leaving customers feeling powerless and frustrated.These inefficiencies have driven me to change my shopping habits. I avoid Walmart.com for time-sensitive purchases because their partnership with FedEx makes reliable delivery nearly impossible. Recently, I discovered that Wayfair.com also uses FedEx, which will now impact my decision to shop with them as well. In contrast, Amazon, which uses UPS and USPS, has consistently provided dependable service.The persistence of these problems highlights a larger issue with corporate accountability. If a company like FedEx cannot uphold the most basic standards of service, why should customers continue to support them? These recurring failures call for drastic action, whether through boycotts, consumer advocacy, or stronger industry regulations to ensure better service.FedEx must prioritize operational improvements, accountability, and customer satisfaction nationwide. Until then, it’s hard to trust this company with the delivery of anything important.Rating: 0/5The Macon and Ellenwood facilities exemplify why customers are losing faith in FedEx. This is not just a local problem—it’s a nationwide crisis that demands immediate attention and reform.","Jan 4, 2025",US

Just called again and the answer is go to Sams and have them file a claim. Cannot get a supervisor. Went to a FedEx office and was told to call the support line. Stopped a FedEx ground driver and was told to call the support line. The support line sounds like they are in India.  Cannot get a resolution. FedEx customer service is about rock bottom as it gets.

In viewing the tracking information the merchandise makes it to Chattanooga, which is about 30 or 40 miles from where I live and it will say ""delivery scheduled for later date"". I have not requested my stuff be delivered at a different date personally so why send it from Chattanooga all the way to Nashville when it would have been easier to just deliver the package. This is costing me money because one of the packages is my dogs month supply of dog food. I'm disabled and don't have the money to keep shelling out for extra stuff when my package was that close to home and it didn't get delivered for whatever reason. This is absolutely ridiculous!! I'm considering taking this to the better business bureau if the problem isn't fixed promptly!! And the worst part about it is when I called to speak to someone they said they couldn't connect me and to call back at a later time then hung up.

FedEx decided to take them from San Bernardino, California to troutdale Oregon and then deliver them back to me. What a waste of money, time and effort. FedEx could reduce its charges if it found somebody to run the shipping like it should. These kinds of mistakes have got to be costly for the company but they don't care. They just pass it on to the customer. I used to use them consistently until items were obviously thrown and not handled with care.

At 4:39 p.m. a FedEx truck (caught on door cam) sailed by the house without stopping yet I got a message saying the driver “attempted delivery” but got no answer at the door. After some phone calls and further misinformation the recipient finally had to go pick up the package at a depot on Dec. 9th so it was never “delivered”.

The location address on Google maps is wrong and brought me somewhere else. After one hour struggling to get in touch with someone over the phone, I was finally directed to the right place. An awful, disgusting and rude woman welcomed me saying that my suitcases weren't there, afrer me getting upset finally they found them. Thw tracking number was changed for some reason and if I didn't go there they would have never been delivered. I made a complaint and after one month an idiot contacted me saying they would have refunded me but they never did. Just a completely trash company.","Dec 30, 2024",IT
1,FedEx employees stealing packages with no consequences,"So again, I was waiting on a package from FedEx. I put a claim in so I could try to get these people that keep stealing our packages caught. But FedEx keeps denying the claims. It’s not about the money it’s about getting these people caught. So FedEx just leaves you hanging After your package was stolen and gives you no reason for the denial. Shame on you FedEx I’ve had more packages stolen from your employees that I just can’t trust shipping with you anymore. And it’s bull crap that we have to keep buying insurance to ship with you guys.. If you ship through FedEx beware. There’s a good chance your package won’t make it. And if you file a claim and take pictures, it doesn’t matter. The pictures I sent in were exact and it shows how the box was ripped open they could even take fingerprints off the plastic, but they just really don’t care. If they did, they would have someone contact me and ask me what happened. All these companies are going in the trash we can’t even trust the mail anymore. Thank you again FedEx for a wonderful job. I guess I’ll be shipping with UPS. They’re the only ones that haven’t screwed me yet. So my fellow readers, please take this to heart. Do not use FedEx cause they will steal from you","Dec 30, 2024",US

It hardly seemed worth it, yet sending the package back wasn’t an option, even if we were willing to pay. The experience felt like blackmail—an example of extortion by Indian customs. When the package was shipped via FedEx in the U.S., they should have informed us that customs duty would be charged upon arrival in India, to be paid by the recipient. Had we known, we wouldn’t have sent such a gift in the first place. This entire process is absolutely unacceptable.","Dec 28, 2024",AE

1,Terrible! Will never choose to use fedex,"Recently I have experienced two separate instances where FedEx has completely dripped the ball on delivery.First, I paid $250 to overnight ship medical supplies to my daughter internationally. It was time-sensitive because her insulin pump stopped working, and she was leaving her current place in 4 days. It arrived 4 days late after she left the country, and although I tried to get my shipping costs back, FedEx never refunded my money. So basically they stole $250 from me, and did not fulfill their promise to deliver the shipment on time which is the only job they have.Second, I am expecting a package. Day 1: we are not home, so they leave a door tag where they haven’t written anything on it. Day 2:  I am home all day. I even leave a sign on front door to FedEx saying we are home, please ring door bell and we will be right down. No one ever came. Yet, I receive a text saying they tried to deliver it and we weren’t home. Lie! We stayed home ALL day. No driver ever darkened our door.  Then, I call and one of the reps says she will have them redeliver tonight. I wait 5 hours. No delivery. I call again and another rep says that rep lied because they don’t reattempt the same day.

I found out from the shipper it was not damaged and they could not give me an explanation why it was shipped back. It was shipped again and finally got to me on 12/27.

On the rare occasion tracking is provided, it shows goods sitting at the local FedEx depot for days. If they do bother loading a delivery onto the vehicle, it is driven around before being returned to the depot at the end of the day. Sometimes the driver claims ""delivery attempted"" or ""premises closed"", despite this being a blatant lie. When asked for evidence, FedEx supply blurry pictures of random streets taken from the window of the FedEx vehicle. When my suppliers contact FedEx for more information, they are fed tall tales I know for a fact are untrue. I now instruct all my suppliers ""avoid FedEx at all costs"".

Package One was sent back 3 times, despite giving clear drop-off instructions and even WAITING near the drop-off site for the package to arrive. After waiting nearly 45 minutes around the typical time frame FedEx tried to leave my package all 3 times (10-11 AMish), I went back inside my house.Lo and behold, I receive a text not less than 15 minutes later that the drop-off was “attempted” and I didn’t see the truck until it was driving FROM THE OPPOSITE AREA OF WHERE I LIVED, leaving their slip on a WHOLE other portion of my condo site. It wasn’t even the right address number!The second package was delivered later THE SAME DAY and it was delivered to ANOTHER part of the condo. It was left outside, completely in view. I was luckily home at the time before heading out for work and grabbed it, but it was on a whole other door on a different section of the building. Again, not MY address number.I go into FedEx to attempt to pick up package one since it was said to be back at the distribution site and lo and behold? They say that “it is out for delivery”. No, it was past 4 PM and my delivery was apparently supposed to be around 11ish. Which it was, and the driver said he couldn’t deliver it when he didn’t even go to the right address.FedEx sucks.

1,FEDEX SCAMS BEWARE!!,"I recently had the worst experience with FedEx, and I want to warn everyone about their sneaky practices. I've been shipping products for years, and I always try to be on the safe side by slightly overestimating the weight of my packages. However, FedEx has taken this to a whole new level of deceit. For my latest shipment, I purposefully listed the weight a tad higher than it actually was. To my astonishment, FedEx managed to magically increase this weight even further, charging me an exorbitant amount—2x to 3x more than what should have been reasonable. This isn't just an error; it feels like a deliberate attempt to gouge customers. It's clear they're playing a game with weights to inflate their charges. People need to be incredibly careful and vigilant when using FedEx services. Don't trust their weight assessments; they seem to weigh things 'even higher' than what you've already padded. My advice? Avoid FedEx if you can, or at least double-check and challenge their weight assessments to avoid being overcharged. This experience has left me extremely frustrated and out of pocket.

1,Ordered set of tires with free shipping…,Ordered set of tires with free shipping from California.  Followed tracking to closest terminal which is 50 miles from me.  Was on the delivery truck and out for delivery on a Thursday.  Didn't show up.  Checked tracking.  Delivery was rescheduled for Friday due to inclement weather.  Don't know why with dry roads and sunshine that day.  Same thing happened again Friday.  Was on the truck again for Saturday.  Finally delivered.  FedEx does not have a problem moving stuff across the country.  It's a problem with the local terminals drivers. The only other problems I've had with FedEx is they've left packages on the road instead of in my driveway and there is usually an inch of dust on the packages because they drive on the side roads with their doors open which I'm getting used to.,"Dec 26, 2024",US

I was at the location from 11:00 AM to 8:00 PM. NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE.It would seem that the driver is not stating the truth or his superiors are allowing him to give false info to inflate their positive delivery metrics. The building has four store fronts. My store front was open from 11:00 to 8:00 PM. Either the driver is incompetent or the driver and his FedEx superiors both are incompetent.

I paid for 2-day shipping. 2-days later at 10:24 AM I received a text from FedEx saying my package was out for delivery. At 6:46 PM the same day I received another text saying that my package would be delayed. Obviously the drive just packed it in for the day. Called 800 GOFEDEX and was told that a report had been submitted and the package would definitely be delivered before the end of the day. Needless to say it never showed up. Yet another reason why as a company we never use FedEx.,"Dec 25, 2024",US
1,Repeated Late deliveries,I have had three late deliveries for my weekly Hello Fresh food deliveries. Two were a week late which I had to throw away. One was a few days late.  It appears in the last year Fed Ex service reputation has fallen greatly. They used to be my favorite and most reliable service. Ironically ever since UPS drivers received their big union raises and loss of huge delivery accounts the Fed Ex services are the poorest ever.  Sadly UPS is kicking butt and now have the huge delivery accounts lost by Fed Ex. Fed Ex was the top service in the past what happened?,"Dec 25, 2024",US

It was supposed to arrive in 2 to 3 days and then it got stuck somewhere and for days it keeps updating the tracking every 12 hours saying it's on the way yet the tracking also says they will update when the package starts moving.

1,This review is specifically for FedEx…,"This review is specifically for FedEx ground which used to be smart post. They are in the worst and most pathetic carrier we have ever experienced. We grown when we say that something we ordered is coming by FedEx. We are now choosing vendors according to who they use for carriers and trying to avoid FedEx Whenever possible. About 80% of our orders coming by FedEx ground just won’t get delivered even though we’ve been told all day long that it’s on the vehicle to be delivered before end of day. Time after time after time it just won’t get delivered. One time the packages sat at the FedEx center from Sunday till Thursday. Another time we ordered a lawnmower and they just let it sit at the facility, refusing to bring it out. We literally had to complain to the seller and order another one! and then they wouldn’t bring it out either so we ended up having to jump through a lot of hoops to figure out how to just go to the facility and pick it up and that was after several phone calls of people telling us that there was nowhere to pick up FedEx packages. we’ll have orders where two or three packages are supposed to be dropped off and maybe one gets dropped off and the other ones just apparently get left in their van and back to their facility that night then they may bring it out in a few days or so. It is the most hideous mail service I have ever experienced and unfortunately on a consistent basis. For the purpose of this review, I have had to put a date, but I can tell you that the things I have described in this review we have experienced three times in the past 10 days.","Dec 25, 2024",US

1,"FedEx Zelienople, PA.. horrible service.","This review is for the Zelienople, PA facility, to whom I’d give 0 stars if I could. 3 weeks late and still waiting for a package that should have taken 3 days or less to deliver is completely unacceptable. Being lied to over and over by customer service reps about the shipment status is unacceptable. Looking at a shipment tracking tool that shows the package “in transit” and “out for delivery”, and then “package arrived (back) at carrier facility” every day for three weeks is not only unacceptable; it’s downright insulting. If you live in an area served by the Zelienople FedEx facility, I’d urge you to either ask any merchant who ships your package if they use FedEx, and if so, ask them to use another shipper, or shop somewhere else.. and if you need to ship anything, consider UPS or the USPS. It’s reasonable for shipping workloads to be hard to keep up with and possibly delayed for 2 or 3 days during a holiday season. Being constantly lied to by customer service reps and misled by tracking details is unacceptable and unreasonable. This facility has a looong history of unacceptably delayed deliveries whether it’s during a busy season or not.","Dec 24, 2024",US

So, I knew I would have a problem on the other end, as Fedex is the only courier that ever and always gives a problem.They held up my card saying that I need to show them an invoice, for something that was not purchased. They didn't ask for any of this info when my father paid to have it sent. I had an invoice of $0 made from my fathers company to show that it costed nothing. The Fedex employee stated that there is no option for packages which costed $0... What?!! So, nobody can Fedex a greeting card?! A gift?! A sample?! You can't send somebody their own property?! How ludicrous does that sound?They force me to fabricate an invoice of more than $0 or they wont give me my package and say will charge me for every day they are holding the card. Whenever, I messaged them they take days to reply. Funny how that works, when they're charging you by the day.Finally, I get my card and now another 2 weeks later  they send me and invoice, for a service that was already paid for and for the import charges of my bank card which I already owned.This is one of the worst companies in the world.

The delivery status will say on the truck for delivery and never gets delivered. This was a gift for Christmas. You call customer service and they tell you lies! Everyone you talk to tell you the something it will be delivered today I can assure you! Fedx is just one big horrible company that tell a bunch of lies to their customers!

1,FedEx delivery estimates and tracking…,"FedEx delivery estimates and tracking are useless. 'Out for delivery' means nothing, as my package was marked out for delivery two different days and didn’t arrive until 3 hrs after the indicated window on the 2nd day. No updates received at all! Tracking showed it was on a FedEx truck out for delivery, then back to the FedEx station the first day. Second day, on a FedEx truck out for delivery, then to a ’trusted 3rd party vendor’, but delivered 3 hrs after the indicated 4 hr window.  Calls to FedEx were not helpful, because they didn’t really know where the package was, and couldn’t tell me who the ‘3rd party was’ to follow up. The whole point of ‘out for delivery’ is so people know their package is arriving... there is too much doorstep theft these days so it’d be helpful if FedEx could stay within the 4 hr window they give you, OR provide updates!!! But, they just show up late without notice, or just not show up at all (first day). My time is important too. HORRIBLE customer service.","Dec 22, 2024",CA

First my package was attempted to be delivered to my home on December 12 as per the tracking app and the door tag left on the 12th of December. They never rang or knocked on the 12th. After review of my camera the driver walked up my walk with no package and then put a door tag in my mailbox. As per the tag no signature or payment was required. The next day when we went to the location on the hang tag they said it was returned as it was over 5 days at location to be picked up. What!Not true. Then on Dec 21 i got a recorded call saying my package needed to be picked up at another Fedex location. i went online to confirm where i was to pick up. went to location and picked up package. Now the email and app both say it was delivered. Not! We had to make two trips to pick up this package. Fedex seems to allow drivers to complete hang tags and put in customer mailbox without knocking, ringing. Fedex is not a delivery company for door delivery they are a drop ship. Customers are to pick up packages at Fedex.","Dec 22, 2024",CA

In other wordfs - there is NO customer service as they don't do anything.Lastly, you can't even contact the local fedex office to find out what is going on because they refuse to give out local office phone numbers.

1,Horrible customer service,"I'm expecting a package before Christmas yet it has become stuck in Illinois (I live in Arizona). This wouldn't be too concerning if we could get a hold of someone, however once the company automated message doesn't have anymore information rather than transferring you to a representative or just says goodbye and hangs up. I have never had an experience where the automated message just hangs up just like that without verifying if your issue is resolved. Then when you look forward any way to contact a living person there is nothing on their website and the automated message after typing in 0 which is supposedly the shortcut to get a representative the message still goes on with the original message. This company does everything it can to avoid settling disputes and doesn't take into account the need of a customer. Basically if you're concerned they lost your package or something along those lines you're outta luck, FedEx used to be reputable in the past, but this current system for customer service is garbage, I would recommend avoiding shipping with them in the future.","Dec 21, 2024",US

My package was assured for delivery, yet it is now stuck between Holyhead Port and its destination in Ireland, with no resolution in sight.Apparently, the port closure that occurred two weeks ago has caused a backlog, but at no point was I informed of this issue before or after shipping my package. FedEx failed to warn customers, which shows a complete disregard for the people relying on their services.What’s worse is the attitude of the customer service representative I spoke to. Not only was I told that my package is ""not important,"" but I was also asked to ""consider the other, more important packages"" stuck due to the delay. This dismissive and downright rude behavior is unacceptable. Every customer's package should matter, and treating customers this way is appalling.FedEx has shown zero accountability in this situation, and their lack of transparency and empathy has ensured that I will never use their services again.

My package ordered from the US spent less time in the States or travelling than roaming around Budapest, Hungary.On 11 December 2024 the package arrived to Hungary and after a difficult customs process, perfectly unnecessary for a hand-made kitchen cutting board, I realized that it will not be delivered by 13 Dec when we leave the country for 5 days to see how other countries' citizens live their calm, undisturbed lives, hence I made a change to the deliver, address which was confirmed on 13 December so I was relieved that my mother-in-law will receive it while we are away.While customs gave me the green light on 12 Dec that they don't need futher info and customs should release the package in 1 working day, the delivery guy only called me on the 18 December (when I asked my mother-in-law to prepare to receive the item from Fedex), so the guy called me that he is in the original address and that the system may not have been updated with the new address. Now I wonder if this is something that should happen for a delivery company in 5 calendar days and 3 working days...The best part for which I had a small nervous breakdown that and for which I will have a special place for Fedex Hungary on my imaginary death list is that today, 19 December is when I was home when I received the email that due to incorrect delivery address the 2nd attempt was unsuccessful. This time, there was no phone call, no bell has been rung and support (phone abd chat) sent me in circles or disconnected while the supposed support was being provided.So I'm actualmy livid and I don't think that such a well-known business should tolerate the joke what is called delivery here in Hungary. Nothing will change my opinion that I shall never use Fedex ever again. Not in Hungary or elsewhere and will warn others about them.Eventually, I am only hoping that my package which I paid the international priority, shall reach me before Christmas 2024...","Dec 19, 2024",HU

Even if you state that your phone number is not working, they will send an email to call a specific number, which convinced me that they are just using AI to respond to us. Like, are we even a customer at this point? Also, I missed a delivery once. All they had to do was leave it at the lobby room, which is safe with CCTV and the super present 24/7. Guess what? They returned it back and made me wait a few days till I decided to use someone else’s number to contact them. Guess what they said? They told me to pick it up at a minimart, which was an hour away. Worst of all, this is the first time I had experienced this in my days of online shopping, and to think this was my first delivery with them, yuk.","Dec 19, 2024",CA
1,Terrible customer service out of…,Terrible customer service out of Springfield il FedEx ground. 7 straight days 2 packages tracking says on the truck for delivery but nothing shows up. Called customer service yesterday and they guaranteed delivery by end of day yesterday. Did not show up. Today one of the two packages arrived. Called customer service and they said it looks like the other package is not on the truck even though it says it is and that's why it was not delivered. So I then got a hold of the office in springfield and asked if I could pick up the item. They said no because the item is on the truck but that I can pick it up tomorrow. I said just deliver it tomorrow than. They said they are busy so they could not guarantee delivery tomorrow. I said the customer service rep told me it is not on the truck so I would like to pick it up tonight. She again said it is on the truck so I can't pick it up tonight and that the truck cannot come back to my house tonight. When asked why they didn't deliver it when they dropped the other package they said they are busy. As if that's a good excuse. Pretty sure it is not on the truck but have the feeling the people in Springfield have no idea what they are doing. Either way I am either being lied to by the Springfield office or the main customer service number. FedEx at this point is horrible. I will do everything I can to choose businesses that don't use them. Both ups and the post office has been great. So FedEx has no excuse. 8 days of out for delivery with no delivery is silly. The guy I work with is having the same issue going on 11 days and gets the same b.s. from the people who work at Springfield il. FedEx is a total waste of time at this point. No reason for this.

1,Don’t choose FedEx for deliveries!,"We recently ordered a bed, and the company chose FedEx for shipping. Considering it’s the holiday season, I understand FedEx might be backed up and overloaded. However, I’d rather wait for my bed than have it delivered damaged or inappropriately.The order had already been delayed, which we were fine with, but when it was delivered today, the experience was beyond frustrating. The delivery driver never rang the doorbell or notified us they were here. I was literally sitting in the room near the front door, waiting for the delivery, and had no idea it had arrived. It wasn’t until I thought I heard a noise outside that I grabbed my coat, opened the door, and saw the FedEx truck driving off.Initially, I thought the delivery had been delayed again or mistakenly delivered to someone else because there was nothing on my porch or nearby. Then I got a notice saying the bed had been delivered. The photo showed siding that matched our house, and that’s when I discovered the bed—left on the side of the house, in the rain. The driver didn’t ring the bell, knock, or even send a text notification.Whether it was a system glitch or negligence, it’s unacceptable. I’m disgusted with both the company for choosing FedEx and with FedEx for their poor delivery standards. I don’t expect white-glove service, but I do expect basic courtesy. Ring the doorbell. Notify me. Don’t leave a brand-new bed out in the rain, leaning against the side of my house, exposed to the elements and in plain view for anyone passing by.Frankly, this level of service is ridiculous, though sadly, not surprising given the declining standards of customer service these days.","Dec 18, 2024",US

1,Bye Felicia!,"My issue is much like the other reviews written today. I am head of an animal rescue and do a lot of online convenience shopping, mostly from Chewy.com who's Dallas warehouse is 6 miles from our address. FedEx is their contracted shipper who's main hub is just out side of Dallas. Unfortunately this has not been an advantage. Over the years I've had my share of delivery issues with FedEx. Chewy has great customer service but unfortunately have no influence on how FedEx runs their service.  I ordered dog food and a bone from a different company out of state on Dec 6 and much like a previous reviewer, still haven't received it. The items were shipped separately. Since Dec 11 I have received daily emails saying items were out for delivery followed by nightly emails with updated estimated delivery dates....what? According to their system items were on the truck. On Dec 14 their system said one of the items (dog food) was returned to the facility for inspection so I figured it was damaged. What about the separate dog bone?  I received an email this morning that it was out for delivery then one this evening saying a new estimated delivery date of today! Their system said they tried to deliver it. Again...what? Their is a large sign on the front gate instructing that deliveries be left outside the gate. They also have terrible customer service who just give you the same info you can get yourself from their system.  I too have decided to stop ordering from companies that use FedEx as their shipper.  My theory is that they use contracted people because they won't pay permanent employees the competitive salary that would draw dependable workers.","Dec 17, 2024",US

My presents are still next to me here in Warsaw. I have been in touch with their customer service dept. every day, and every day they tell me the delivery will be on that day, until I just in the evening realise it's not going to be the case after all. This company truly does not give a shit about their customers, it's the first time in my life when I have bought a service for hundreds of 800 PLN, but I will simply have to cancel the order as the company does not care about the service I have been promised, and doesn't really seem to care about loosing my money either...

EVERY PACKAGE that is delivered by FedEx is nearly the same. Wait and wait only to be told they attempted delivery when they made no attempt at all.

5,Praise for employee Kristina Ross,"I had the good fortune to be in the FedEx store in the Walmart at 6626 FM1960 Road E.Humble, TX 77346on December 12th, 2024Kristina Ross was a one-woman show that day!  She showed me how to utilize the self-serve machine to print up my Christmas cards, she handled people who were waiting for a package, people who had a package to drop off, packages that were very badly wrapped and barely held together, people who were missing parts of a shipment, she did it all, with grace and efficiency.  She was polite and kind and maintained her sense of humor throughout it all.  She is the kind of person who treats your business as though it were her business.  When it comes time for her employee review, I hope you take this message to heart and show her some love.  She's one you want to keep.~ Jordana Capra","Dec 15, 2024",US

This is the fourth time this year that my package was delivered to the wrong address! And it is impossible to get in touch With a human being to be able to get help for it. They're supposed to be responsible for picking up the package where they delivered it incorrectly and bring it to you but I've been looking for over an hour and it just keeps sending me to the same  basically nonworking customer service number where the phone robot is not able to help me at all it just keeps hanging up on me!,"Dec 14, 2024",US

1,Fed Ex actually lied to us again today…,"Fed Ex actually lied to us this week about my overnight delivery. Saying it'd be here yesterday between 10:20 and 2:20pm...at 1:30pm they said it'd be here between 2:30pm and 3:30pm...Then they said...""it'd be here by the end of the day"". At 9:30pm we gave up waiting for the 5 packages. This morning we got emails saying it's out for delviery with Marcos again and it'd be here between 9:30am and 1:30pm. I called Fed Ex and the customer service gal said that wasn't correct. She said that location didn't deliver on the weekends even though my email said it was out for delivery for the second day by Marcos. Fed Ex actually just makes up crap to tell you. So, even though my packages were paid for overnight shipping...Fed Ex just lies about this feature. Fed Ex...the worst. Here's a follow up on my review here. Today...it's starting again. Got 5-6 emails again from Fed Ex saying my 5 packages would be delivered today between 10:20am - 2:20pm . Then I got. a call back from a clueless Fed Ex customer service gal saying they'd be here between 2:00pm and 5:30pm not realzing that I had the emails saying otherwise. She didn't know I was getting the emails. So, the chaos continues with Fed Ex. DAY 5 OF NON-Delivery of my 5 packages.

1,FedEx should go bankrupt - terrible service,"FedEx must hire the most incompetent drivers, or there is a scam going on like I have read in other reviews on the internet. Not sure if it is my branch but based on reviews, it sounds like this is a widespread problem and that FedEx might benefit from hiring a new CEO to avoid going bankrupt. The problem is that NOBODY CARES and there is NOTHING YOU CAN DO to get them to change or improve their service. They just don't care about anything other than making money and checking off that they supposedly delivered a package when in reality, many of the drivers are just lazy and don't want to take the time to ensure your package gets to the right place.I ordered 3 packages from the same clothing company that uses FedEx as their shipper. Package #1 made it successfully to my front door/porch - score. Package #2, however, was dropped in the alley behind my house in the rocks and dirt - luckily it had not been stolen. Eventually I located it as I opened my garage to leave for work. Package #3 was marked as delivered but was nowhere on my property. I attempted to call FedEx customer service and all I got was the runaround with no way to reach an agent to tell them NO, THE PACKAGE IS NOT HERE! I DON'T CARE IF IT SAYS DELIVERED!! My daughter was nice enough to walk around the neighborhood to see if she could see packages on porches. She checked on one porch and discovered my packages were left at an entirely different house down the block! Can they read numbers? Do they know how to read a map? Or are they just incompetent or are they running a scam just to check the box saying they delivered to get their check and who gives a damn about your packages? FedEx - 1 out of 3 successful deliveries = 33%, which according to my math is an F.I have let the clothing company know that unfortunately, because they use FedEx as their shipper, I can no longer order from them because it is not worth the hassle to deal with lost items due to incompetent or thieving drivers. Oh, and by the way, this doesn't even include the package they lost 2 years ago that, to this day, has never been located and was worth over $115. At first, FedEx said my claim would not be honored and there was nothing they could do. After digging around in the maze that is the FedEx customer service department and threatening legal action, we eventually got someone to honor our claim and we received a check for the lost box. But again, the box has disappeared into the ether to this day.Do better, FedEx. Even the USPS is more reliable than you at this point.","Dec 14, 2024",US

Luckily Sam’s club canceled the cards and refunded me. My issue is they took no accountability, were there any repercussions for the thief driver I don’t know 🤷 .

They are always running extremely late, not even just a day behind but over a week+ and not just during the holidays. A shipping journey that should only take 3 days turns into 2 weeks. Don't let the package have any weight to it either because they will just leave it at the road where anyone can steal it, or mark stuff delivered that was never delivered. Even the USPS is better then they are and that's saying something. If I know a company uses fedex as a shipping company I won't buy anything from them, and unfortunately sometimes the company only will say overnight or ground and I won't know what carrier they are using and I unfortunately find out it's dreaded fedex, I think company's don't like to say who it is because they know they will loose business and people will go purchase from somewhere else because they know there package will take forever and also be at risk for being stolen because it will be left out where anyone can easily steal it. You would think after several years of thousands of horrible reviews every year they would make some changes but nope!!! they just keep the same crappy service going, I also know people who work for fedex and refuse to use them as a shipper because its that bad, kinda crazy it's that bad you're own employees won't use there employer's services because its that poor.

1,Today,"Today, as a result of the strike by Canadian postal workers, I visited my local Staples store to send out three small parcels by FedEx to family for Christmas. I live on Vancouver Island in suburban Victoria. The first destination was an Ontario address some 4300 km away according to Google maps. I was told the expected arrival date was December 18, only 6 days away and the least expensive cost (ground transportation) for a package about 12”x10”x6” and weighing less than 5 pounds would be just over $48. Good enough.The next package was about half the size and weight and bound for an address in Alberta some 1300 km away. Based on the same means of transport the cost was just over $47. Before I could properly express my disbelief, the clerk had managed to calculate a cost for my third item, a 6 by 9 inch bubble-wrap envelope going to a street address in the village of Pemberton, 294 km northeast of the store. “That will be just over $59,” she said. As I began to sputter, she simply rolled her eyes and with a pained expression said, “I’m sorry but all of the rates have been adjusted since the strike began.”This is just another loathsome an example of corporate greed. The fact that it’s not quite morally akin to hiking the price of bottled water 20 times over at the site of a wildfire is effectively offset by the fact that you’re handling Christmas presents.

Also contacted store I place the order with. Will be returning to the store and expect a full refund and then some. Another order is due for delivery by end of day today (8p); expect the same to happen.... I know I won't be getting what was ordered. Take my advice, don't use them if at all possible. UPDATE: received an email stating my case had been closed... no explanation. Called and was told an ""investigation"" was done and there was no history of damage, re-taping or anything. Told the person that was the reason why someone was supposed to be coming. Another package that was supposed to be delivered today has been rescheduled until tomorrow... hopefully. No notification. The reason: high volume and issues with the trucks. Anyway, will do another update if package isn't delivered tomorrow. 2ND UPDATE: Package scheduled for delivery yesterday and rescheduled for today arrived right at the beginning of the estimate timeframe; no issues/problems.

Or not even showing respect for the ""hostage in own house-client"" by not writting as it happened yesterday.Today, Fedex sent a message at 9:50am alleging ""they were sorry for the delay"" and that the package shall be dropped off before noon.  At 11:21am Fedex sent another message telling that the delivery was rescheduled due to abbsence of the adressee... But no one rang to my door nor a single phone call did I receive.Frustrated and really angered by been mocked, I reached Fedex's web page chat for customer service through my phone. The customer service agent claimed that the ID tracking number I had was not from Fedex, even though that was the one shown in Fedex's receipt and corporate mails. The lady said the package was handled by a local partner called TNT and that both parties are not yet fully alligned, for I had to go afte TNT in order to rescue my -International Priority mail-.  I checked on the TNT tracking link, and that ID number Fedex sent me was not in their data base...Suddenly, at 12:28pm, a very rude Spanish guy claimed he had a package from Fedex. Scared it might be a scam, I answered Fedex had messaged they cancelled the delivery more than an hour before and he rudely yelled at me ""¿Quieres el paquete o no ah?"" (Do you want or not the package huh?).In conclusion, Fedex HAS NO CONTROL OF IT'S LOGISTICS, nor the information along his company or ally´s personel.

1,A broken company,"Factual timeline of events: The package according to the tracking was supposed to be delivered on the 4th December by 6pm. On Monday 2nd December, FedEx sent me an email requesting more information for customs clearance. I replied the same day. I did not hear anything on Tuesday from Fedex, and on Wednesday 4th December, Fedex asked me to pay customs clearance. I paid within a few hours of receiving the email. There was no action on Thursday, and by Friday 6th December, I had already called FedEx customer service several times asking when the package would be released. I asked for the package to be held at the depot, so I could come collect it by 7pm. I went to the Fedex Depot at Prestonwickweg 1, Schipol at 6.30pm on Friday 6th December. The Head of Customs (a gentleman with white hair wearing a blue sweater, sorry I did not get his name), told me that FedEx had made an internal error with selecting the wrong clearance code. From this internal error made by FedEx, customs did not clear the package in time, and I could not pick it up on Friday 6th December. The Head of Customs took my number, and assured me that I would be called on Monday with an update, and that it would be delivered to my address to avoid me having. On Monday 9th December at around 11am, I received a call from the FedEx team advising me that it has cleared customs and it will be delivered today. I asked her specifically to ensure it would be delivered to my address, because previously I asked the delivery to be held. She ensured me it would be delivered to my address. It was not delivered on Monday or Tuesday. On Wednesday 11th, I called FedEx and asked why the package had not yet been delivered. The customer service agent told me that there was a ""hold at depot"" request and that's why it has not been delivered to my address. I asked her to change this so that it was delivered to my address, that same day, as it was already overdue. She said she made the change to the file to ensure the package was going to be delivered to my address. It was not delivered on Wednesday 11th December. On Thursday 12th December, I called the customer service in the morning to ask if my package was going to be delivered today to my address. She told me that the package was ""requested to be held at the depot"". I told her that this was wrong, and I requested to change it to be delivered at my address the day before. She told me there was no request, and that the package had not been scheduled for delivery. She said she lodged a request now to change this. About 20 minutes later (also on Thursday 12th December), I called back to ensure that the request had been worked on. The man on the phone told me that no request had been raised, and there was nothing pending to change. The package was still ""requested to be held at depot"". By this point, I asked for two things (1) proof that the request had been lodged, and (2) speaking to someone else who could make this happen today. He gave me (1), the case number (will send in a DM), which I am tracking closely for updates. And (2), he refused to hand me over to someone else to discuss the case. Overall complaint: Due to an internal customs error and continuous promises that cases or requests were raised even though they never were, FedEx Express is now 7 business days late to deliver an *express* package that was initially promised on the 4th December. Things go wrong with deliveries all the time, but how a company fixes it is what matters most to me. FedEx has continuously proved that they are incapable of fixing their errors. Whilst your customer service staff have been largely empathetic, their actions have been useless (or perhaps their actions were useful, but the systems or the chain of command is broken). Ultimately, I absorb the damage. My request: I am not looking for apologies, I am looking for action. My request is that the package is delivered to my address by Friday 13th December, 4pm. I will DM you with the tracking number.","Dec 12, 2024",NL

1,Never Import Reps into India Using FedEX,"This review is exclusively for The Monopoly called FedEX India and more precisely about Importing from China to India.The service fee for customs handling of FedEx is1200rs inclusive of the GST.One nasty thing FedEX does is they will do their own due diligence on the item that is being imported and find more ways to make a case out of it such that they can earn through case handling fee. I believe their custom handling agents have some sort revenue targets they need to achieve on a monthly basis or else why would they do the following?I recently ordered an aftermarket BMW headlight from China, because I don't want to pay ""BMW money"" for the OEM headlight which is only as good as the Aftermarket part. In China, an aftermarket headlight for the BMW costs only twice as much as any standard headlight but that's acceptable cause the quality of these aftermarket BMW headlights are on par with the OEMs if not they are all the same.But FedEX marked the item as ""under valued"", right after the received the item in china, the tracking read ""declared value of the shipment does not justify actual value"" based off the invoice, even before presenting it to customs.I think they were like BM headlights - 220$ only? no way! (Cause the original BMW headlight was around $900, The Chinese aftermarket one was only $220) FedEX doesn't even realize it's not the original item and made my headlight to be seized for undervalue purposefully! Which I am pretty sure of cause, customs would never do such a things ( $220 for a headlight is still too much in India anyway!) but FedEX managed to make a case out it, with no customer support to explain the issues, they just send a bill bearing the penalty, duty, service change, convenience charge, GST IGST etc.. in the end, I decided to pay 40% of 900$ as if i am importing the original headlight! + plus the penalty + plus 3000 extra to FedEX for the case handling charges plus + the 1200 service charge for FedEX presenting the item to customs! and don't forget the 9000 Rs they asked for ""premium shipping"" in the first place. The overall cost came closer to original BMW headlight, which I could've easily payed the official service center and got it fixed.Never import Reps into India using FedEX.","Dec 11, 2024",IN

1,FedEx the delivery source? RUN!,"Another day, another package lost by FedEx. Had a package from a big company ship me something that was broken into two shipments (honestly, if I knew FedEx was the delivery source I would have avoided ordering because there is ALWAYS an issue with delivery) - I saw that one was attempted delivery, but couldn't get into my apartment building so the delivery failed. I called FedEx to add notes to both of my packages (it wouldn't let me do it online - because that would be too easy??), and went on my way without issue. Receive a photo today of a package delivered and left OUTSIDE on a busy street (downtown street). Called to say what the heck only for them to tell me no notes were actually added to the call. Okay, first issue. Next, I explain I have another package coming and I'm worried about the same thing happening. They then proceed to tell me they saw the notes but refuse to leave the package inside of the lobby without a signature. (I said, you realize the irony in that, right? I'm asking you to leave my package somewhere safe and you are refusing but will leave it outside where it is absolutely not safe...). Instead, I asked for my package to be diverted to a local FedEx spot (another issue for the website: it can never find these spots around me!), and they said I can't until it's been marked as an attempted delivery (even though a delivery has been attempted, the driver isn't marking it as such, meaning I can't do anything about it). Absolutely no communication between representatives and drivers, and never able to talk to a manager (edit: last summer they lost a $200 package with sold out clothes that were unable to be replaced, and after 12 phone calls to FedEx I did get in touch with a manager - who had to call me back - to tell me that they had, in fact, lost my package. They said it was ""sitting in a warehouse somewhere but [you/I] can't just show up as it's in a pile and they don't know what pile because that is inside of a shipping container somewhere"". Absolutely ridiculous that FedEx can get away with things like this - are there no laws around this? I know it's just a package but the amount of undue STRESS and TIME lost is just totally unacceptable (any other business would be cancelled by now if they adhered to this).

Then I wait in all day the following day to find that someone had come to the door and left the note without knocking, even my dog didn't hear it. Then the website tells me they're going to delivery the following day, they do not.

1,Awful,"Awful. Their system couldn't generate a label for an international parcel. It then prompted me to contact their live chat. The 1st agent asked information step by step rather than all at once and then said they finish their shift so will pass on the information so the 2nd agent can continue. 2nd agent proceeded to ask the same information. 3rd agent decided to not give any reason why the system couldn't generate the label and just said they'll cancel and refund.All of this took 1 hour. If this takes 3 people 1 hour, then I cannot wait for AI to replace you and speed up your operations as this is clearly unacceptable and I will never use FedEx again.I was then given a statement regarding giving feedback and then bombarded with information and then the feedback section failed to load.","Dec 9, 2024",GB

Sat morning still no delivery.   Sat morning I called back and explained to them once again that the passport my wife needs to get on the plans is an emergency as she is the chaperone of 5 children and the children cannot leave without her.  It fell on uncaring ears.  The passport is in Calgary and they will get to it when they can.  Needless to say they will have a lawsuit on their hands to deal with.  6 flights home  hotel charges  meals  Uber  all because they wouldn't make an effort while they still had time to solve this absurdity.  I hope the people in charge makes heads roll.  One of the kids parents is a trial lawyer and says we have an excellent case against Fedex.Update  passport has been sitting in Calgary Fedex depot for 48 hours.

1,Are you freaking KIDDING me.,"Yeah, it must be nice to receive a full-time salary while being able to remain absolutely incompetent and free from any and all accountability. Took off of work yesterday to stay home to sign for a high-value shipment where direct signature was required. Tracking listed ""10:40am to 2:40pm"" which of course came and went with no package, and no tracking updates. Later in the afternoon, it was changed to ""by end of day"". However, the package was still sitting in a facility over 2.5 hours away. Over 27 hours later, the package finally left the facility, and tracking was updated to ""10:40am to 2:40pm today"", which of course got bumped to ""by end of day"" after 2:40pm came and went. It's not even listed as ""out for delivery"", so I called FedEx to have them confirm the actual day it is scheduled to be delivered. Monday, which is two days from now. So, let me get this straight: It sat 2.5 hours away for over 27 hours on a non-holiday weekday, and it won't make it to me for 72 hours after all? Either this is all a joke (which the customer service rep confirmed was not the case, before I hung up on him for his inability to provide me with any other answers whatsoever), or FedEx is literally the absolute most worthless carrier I have ever, ever encountered. UPS and USPS both royally suck, but FedEx has somehow managed to underperform even those two. That, my friends, takes an unbelievable amount of effort to achieve.","Dec 7, 2024",US

I will definitely check before place my Amazon orders moving forward. if it's by Fedex, then I will not place order for sure.

But of course it never showed up. they then said they would deliver today by 1:20 PM so i stayed home so i would be here to sign for it. No show by 1:30. Now it says it will be here by the end of the day, so i have to stay home all day so i can sign for it, or risk missing the delivery and having to deal with even more inconvenience. Assuming the driver even knocks on the door when he gets here. In the past I've had drivers walk up to my house with the ""sorry we missed you"" note already filled out and they just stick it to the door and walk away without even trying to deliver, even when I'm home waiting for them.

1,Fedex Shipping Issue,"Did an upgrade with ATT online after the local store was out of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. It was shipped by RLC today via Fedex. It requires a signature and every restriction possible. Fedex says ATT needs to call them to allow holding it at the local Walgreens, but ATT says they can't do that. Fedex also doesn't allow the option to deliver at a time when I'll be home. I work all day from 8-5pm. I've told both Fedex and ATT that they can cancel my order and ship the item back. I will not sign the door tag to have it left at my residence. The ATT rep was very nice I talked to, but this is a systemic failure by both ATT and Fedex. UPS is great and I've never had issues with them. I'd switch to another carrier, but unfortunately, ATT is the only carrier with service where I live. Fedex is a complete joke and I avoid them like the plaque. There is a reason UPS delivers more packages then them.","Dec 7, 2024",US

Why was the tracking status never updated??? So I call FedEx Customer Service and the lady tells me that the package was already shipped back to Italy and that they should have the package. Well, so I call the website where I placed the order and they told me that's extremely fishy and that if they DID ship it back to sender, there should be a new tracking provided (which there isn't) and they never received the package.

That's great until you get home to find they haven't left a card saying which neighbour it's been left with....all the neighbours I've tried so far didn't receive it.

They were called and said they definitely would be delivered, then the map went dead and the next online map said ""we will give a date and time once the truck moves"". The damned truck moved all day and didn't deliver parts I need tomorrow ! What a way to jerk around a customer ! So now they can't tell me when it will be delivered or the day?

I took the day off, but as usual, they just updated the delivery date at 6 PM that they will instead deliver tomorrow. I tried to talk to a person to ask how probable it is that the delivery will be re-scheduled again tomorrow, because for obvious reasons I cannot sit at home every day hoping for the package arrives, but guess what, you can try their chat assistant or their phone assistant, both will be utterly useless, just a waste of time, designed to keep the facade of a customer support, but prevent you from being able to talk to a human and actually resolve your problem. FedEx consistently proves how little they care about their customers, or the damage they cause. They ignore feedback and utterly arrogant. I wish a respectful competitor enters the market and removes this joke of a company from the map. Since same basically happens every time when my delivery is fulfilled by FedEx, from now on I will try to prevent ordering from companies using FedEx to deliver and will suggest them to pick another company for delivery.","Dec 6, 2024",CA

No one knows. The driver clearly lied, and I was left to sort out their mess.I spent three days calling FedEx customer service, only to be given the same useless responses: “Call in an hour,” “Call tomorrow,” “Check again later.” No accountability, no solutions—just a complete waste of my time. To make matters worse, I had to physically check multiple convenience stores in my area, and unsurprisingly, no one had my parcel.FedEx doesn’t just fail to deliver packages—they deliver stress and frustration.

1,Fed ex management ruined what was a quality company,"I have used Fed-Ex for decades and have an account. They failed to get my parcel to it's destination on the promised date. This is bad but using their ""support"" in India or online is enough to make a person ill. The person in India, (very low volume levels set) ask many questions: 11 digit trackiing number for instance, when you give them it, they'll put you on hold for each question asked and return saying something non-sensical like they need an 11 digit tracking number, which you have already given 3 or 4 times and when they read back the 11 digits they'll say they can't find it. Can't find anything after having, 45 minutes earlier, located your name, account number, delivery address. Then they can't forward you to a supervisor or to Engand for help. Then they'll say they're closing and try tomorrow (17:45) and I've already been trying to locate my  parcel for an hour and 15 minutes. Fed Ex has also charged my account an extra £278  (another delivery) for weight? taxes?. Everything that leaves my building is weighed and photographed. I think they cause so many problems in the hope that a normal person would just walk away and let them have their money- that's how unpleasant and robotic (plus India where nothing gets addressed or solved.) it is. I saw a news article on Zero Hedge last week of a Fed Ex depot in the States being raided and plundered (stolen) by so called police. Look it up and see the footage. I will never use this company again. The way it's being run feels like the end of western civilization.","Dec 3, 2024",GB

I paid, printed the label, and dropped it off.This evening, I received an email from FedEx that the package had been received, I was on its way. The delivery date now shows us Thursday, instead of Tuesday. I went online, there are no longer any chat agents, just to chat bot that does not help. I called the hotline, and was outsourced to India, and was told that her system does not even show that the package was picked up yet, even though I already received an email that it was. She had to go on to fedex.com herself, to verify the package was picked up and is showing a delivery date of Thursday. She said it is peak season, and all packages are taking longer than normal. Which is understandable, but should be told up front. Even now, the website still shows one day shipping for ground delivery to my destination area. If packages are delayed, change the website! Change the expectation of your customers, and let us choose accordingly. I would have gone to UPS, if I knew FedEx was so backed up. The chat agent could do nothing to help, and told me just wait for the package on Thursday. She could not upgrade the shipping, and could not refund the payment.

He walked out the truck and shortcut towards our door through our garden, stepping over our flowerbed, bushes, and grass area. He dropped a package and immediately started shouting at the wife that she must not open the door until he leaves since he saw a dog in the house. The dog was not outside during the time the deliveryman was ruining our garden. He left the house walking back on our flowers, bushes, and grass areas instead of the driveway. He made a few other drops in the street and came back to our house and shouted more towards us cursing the wife and husband. A deliveryman shall not peek into the privacy of clients’ homes, shall not break into private gardens, shall not shout at clients, and shall not even tell clients what to do at their properties. Instead, this deliveryman shall go to a psychiatrist to handle his mental disorder with pets and people and learn how to control his excessive anxiety and impulsive aggression.  Clearly, FedEx and LAST MILE DELIVERY SOLUSIONS completely failed to address the deliveryman’s misbehavior and its wrong-choosing of employees. FedEx manager has lied to us that the matter was addressed, dishonoring himself and FedEx together.   Therefore, we are left with confronting FedEx and LAST MILE DELIVERY SOLUSIONS directly. We have started legal procedures for taking the companies to court and making sure this delivery-boy and his lying manager both lose their jobs. We, with our attorney, seek a restrain order for this criminal delivery-boy. We have filed a police report on this third incident and put a ‘no-trespassing to all FedEx deliverymen’ sign in front of our lot.

It is now 7:24 p.m.  When I started my ""chat"" with a representative, it was just a few minutes past 7:00.  I gave the rep my FedEx tracking number.  She said she would contact someone to look into it FOR $5.00 - ""Fully Refundable"".  First of all, why do I have to pay someone to do their job, and secondly, ya right -- I'm going to get my $5 refunded!  That is as sure a thing as getting my package delivered when they say it will be delivered.  As this is not the first time I have experienced this with FedEx, I will not be placing orders with companies that choose them for their delivery purposes.  I checked my ""status"" just before writing this.  It appears the person I ""chatted"" with took out my delivery date of today.  It went back to ""received at FedEx on November 27"".  Who knows when I'll get it now but if it is ruined because I was not home to get it in my refrigerator, or if it is stolen off my porch because I could not be home, they will be held responsible.","Nov 30, 2024",US

1,Fed-Ex Service is Lousy,"I received an email from Fed-Ex that a delivery required a signature. It gave me an option to sign online. I followed the prompts and got a message that their system couldn't accommodate this request. I called 800.goffedex to find out why. After being in virtual assistant hell for 15 minutes I finally got a live person. I explained the situation after giving all the particulars (name, address, tracking number etc.). The service rep then told me I'd have to speak to an international help person. Waited on hold for minutes and finally got someone. Had to repeat all the particulars. After numerous apologies and alternative suggestions she said I'd have to speak with a tech rep. Fed up with Fed-Ex service I decided to have the package held for pickup. I completed that process.Today I got a door tag and email stating Fed-Ex tried to deliver to my house but couldn't as I wasn't there to sign. Said they'll try again Monday.This is not the first time I've had issues with Fed-Ex. Each time their customer service isn't helpful and the company can't even follow instructions from its own website.If I could give Fed-Ex a negative rating I would. Even the post office is better than this outfit.","Nov 30, 2024",US

1,The worst experience I’ve ever had,"The worst experience I’ve ever had. I paid for express shipping so I could get my package early, but that didn’t happen. The first attempt was during the day (around 12-1 PM), which is impossible for me since I work night shifts. That alone would’ve been fine if they hadn’t completely ignored the updated delivery instructions I provided when I called to create a ticket. I included multiple fail-safes, yet two days later, they ignored every single one.When I called customer service 35 minutes after the missed delivery, I was passed around with long waits and empty promises, only to be told the driver was already back at the facility—nearly an hour away. For that to be true, they would’ve had to break traffic laws or not attempt delivery at all. Now I have to wait another two days for another delivery attempt or drive over an hour to pick up a package I paid express shipping for.The first missed delivery was partially my fault, but ignoring clear instructions after I called to resolve the issue? That’s unacceptable. If you're a company considering this service for your customers, DON’T. They don’t care about you or your problems.","Updated Nov 30, 2024",US

My package should’ve arrived well over a week ago. I have no idea when or if I’ll ever get it. It bounced around to several cities only 10 miles apart for days on the way here.

When I asked him if wouldn’t mind just putting them inside the door he refused, saying “we’re not allowed”. When I told him I was unable to lift heavy boxes he shouted at me “you shouldn’t order heavy boxes then” and stormed off. I’ve had a mastectomy and lymph nodes removed due to cancer, I can’t lift anything heavy, according to Fed Ex that excludes me from ordering online. Who the hell does this company or this driver think they are? I didn’t ask him to bring the parcel right inside my house, just to put it inside the door. I am so angry I am literally shaking. The foulest company and person I have ever encountered. I have lots of home deliveries as I struggle with my health and never ever have I had this attitude from any other courier. Will be taking this further as this is discrimination against anyone disabled or elderly and Fed Ex has no right to prevent people from ordering whatever they want and have it delivered securely by a driver with some common decency.","Nov 29, 2024",GB

He left my gate completely torn up and open and photographed the package out on the sidewalk. I filed a claim and FedEx is not going to do anything about it. I had a contractor come out and look at the damage and it’s going to cost me thousands of dollars to have it replaced because it can’t be fixed. Anyone know a good attorney?,"Nov 29, 2024",US

1,FedEx has become the worst delivery…,FedEx has become the worst delivery service I’ve ever dealt with. Several times I had issues with them delivering my package to the wrong address. One time a FedEx truck came to the road I stay on but didn’t bother to pull into my driveway. Then I get a notification the package was attempted to be delivered & the address didn’t exist.

1,Worst customer service,"I have never experienced a worse customer service. If I could give negative 5 stars I would.I wrote on chat yesterday (Nov 25th) as I got no updates on a package that was scheduled to be delivered to my local pickup point. Here I was assured by the customer service agent Shah that it had actually been delivered. So I went to the pickup point and they could tell me that they had absolutely no package, and that their tracking showed exactly the same as mine. Waste of my time. So I went on the chat again (as it is impossible to talk to them on the phone unless you have an account). Here Dominik gave me the rudest and worst “service” I have ever experienced. He said that it had been delivered to FedEx Facility in Kastrup - over 30 km from where I live, by mistake. I needed that package yesterday, so I asked him to have it redelivered to my home adress same evening. He then redirected it to me. However he said that it wouldn’t come until today. Then I asked him to cancel the redirection and have it delivered at my pickup point. To which he once again said it was impossible (and not stating why btw), to which I asked for another pickup point where he then claimed that they don’t have pickup points in my vicinity (BULLSHIT).Then I woke up this morning to a shipping notification that it actually would be delivered to my pickup point. However, as I had experienced a lot of incompetence from FedEx already, I chose to doubt this as I suspected that they would mess up again. So I wrote on the Chat, this time with Rakim. He assured me that the shipping notification was right and would be delivered at my pickup point today. Hours went by with no updates on the tracking. So I opened the chat again and talked to Rakim - again - who now answered very rudely and annoyed that they were delivering to the pickup point.Not even 15 minutes later I get a notification that they had tried to deliver… TO MY HOME ADDRESS!!! I therefore got on the chat ONCE AGAIN. This time I talked to Karolina that was very nice and helpful and who admitted that there had been done a lot of mistakes on their part, and she would raise a case. She gave me a case ID and asked me to wait for FedEx to contact me on email or phone (I asked for Email as I was working). My phone calls an hour later. I pick up, but the caller hung up when I said my name. From caller ID I could see that it was FedEx, but as they had used main line number I couldn’t call back. So I went on the chat again, talked to Martyna who wrote that she would have them contact me again. To which I awaited their call.No call, and customer support closing at 6 pm, made me write on chat again, where Weronika informed me that they had rerouted my package AGAIN and that this process could take up to 3 days… and that they wouldn’t call me back before tomorrow or possibly Thursday. I asked for a manager but was told that this was also not possible before tomorrow.You guys are the most irresponsible, incompetent bunch of amateurs.","Nov 26, 2024",DK

I have never heard of a delivery company having a policy of refusing to deliver above the ground floor even if the customer is disabled. When they gave an excuse of theft i said why not lock their doors like EVERY OTHER COMPANY they responded with well some do......

I spoke to an agent, the only resolution was for me to drive across town to pick it up on Monday.  I don’t  have much faith that the package will be there Monday, that it still won't make it back onto a truck.  I asked why it wasn't scheduled for delivery today..because the  seller didn't indicate  weekend delivery.  Well why did they given an estimated delivery day of today,  Saturday?

It’s sad that their only job is to deliver package and cannot do that right. The only way to contact them is by phone because they don’t want their complaints in writing, so they can pretend it didn’t happen.

I waited n waited...then another email at 10am to say it's delayed and will be delivered before 6pm. From then on, no update or any communications. The tracking system still says the same. The online chat keeps adking me to contact customer services in USA. After going round the gardens many times, I eventually found a local number. I was then explained that they have split my shipment, some are in Hong Kong and some are still in UK...there's no definite date and time of delivery.What a nightmare...I've been sitting around all day waiting.

I've contacted the FedEx company, NO HELP!

It’s hard to believe FEDEX has been in business for so long and has no basic competency in accepting shipping tracking and delivering packages.

When I discovered this and tried to get them to pick up a very important package of T-shirts for my daughter with breast cancer, and a race her sisters were running for her, they were totally unwilling to help. Claimed they could not get my package back and did absolutely nothing to help. They claimed that they could do nothing because it was not within seven days and they absolutely were not interested in addressing the situation. I offered to pay them to get my t-shirts, and they refused because they don't have a label and were unwilling to assist me in any way at all. This is the most uncooperative, insensitive business that I have ever dealt with. It's simply of no interest to them to provide any support to individual customers at all. I happen to own a publishing business, something they do not know, and you can be absolutely certain that every one of the retailers we utilize will be told that they are not allowed to use FEDEX for any of our shipments.","Nov 21, 2024",CA

1,Appalling Service,Absolutely appalling Company to deal with. I sent a parcel to my son and listed the items being couriered.  (A replacement phone as my sons had been stolen). Apparently you need a civil cryptography permit for a phone to clear customs.  At no time was I advised of this and no help given on the estimated hundred of calls to Fedex.  They just kept requesting money and blaming other parties for the problem.  They also opened complaint cases and closed them down without doing anything to help.  After 5 weeks the phone was finally returned to myself and the cost in total was £350 for the undelivered parcel.  My son is still without a phone and I have to now pay another courier to ship the parcel.  I rated 1 star but that is because I had to pick something.  To be honest I would not recommend them and will not recommend them to anyone.Terrible customer service.

If you call providing the automated system a tracking number, they’ll only give you certain options before disconnecting. If you don’t give them the tracking number wanting a customer service agent, the system will still disconnect. FedEx doesn’t frequently update their system either. Sometimes it’s 24 hours or longer where the agents don’t have a clue. Once I contacted customer support (before the new changes) 2-3 times speaking to agents. I had 2-3 agents tell me the same thing that they never received the package from shipper because it was in created a label status. They debated me nonstop. When the shipper contacted them, they updated the system showing they had it for almost 2 days.  Now it’s the same thing. Shipper emailed me they used FedEx with a tracking number. Now FedEx claims they don’t have it. I can’t get through their terrible automated system.","Nov 20, 2024",US

Then trying to call and talk to anybody at all in customer support is completely is always completely impossible. All you ever get is the stupid recording and machine to talk to that is never any help at all in the least bit until it just hangs up on you. I've hit the point where I legitimately and openly ALWAYS request the shipper to ship with literally anybody other than fedex because apparently fedex here in Washington DC is complete trash and they are beyond incapable of delivering packages and are simply incompetent. I watched the stupid live deliver tracker show me that apparently my package and driver were nearby my house I guess making other stops all afternoon long and never came here to my house, AGAIN. And last week I received a package from fedex, and guess what, it was the completely wrong address. It was supposed to be delivered to a house 4 blocks over, so instead of bothering with incompetent fedex I just put the package in my car and took it over to the correct house and delivered it myself.

I had to stay in all that time as a signature was required.  If missed, a redelivery charge would be applied.  The delay totally disrupted daily life with delivery forecasts sometimes described very broadly eg. 'by the end of the day' making it impossible to plan. I attempted to leave alternative instructions for leaving the parcel in a safe place but their website options were 'not available'.  On the day, no signature was requested, adding insult to injury! I contacted Fedex to complain and seek recovery of the delivery costs.  They called to apologise but said they had no means of refunding the cost of delivery.

Then in the middle of the night I received a notification that my package will arrive in 2 more days.  Keep in mind my food is NOT FROZEN.  CUSTOMER SERVICE JUST LIE TO YOU TO GET YOU OFF THE PHONE.

1,Drivers unable to read address labels correctly.,"I had placed an order with Temu which was shipped via FedEx.  While I made the mistake of putting the incorrect unit number on the delivery address, I did have the correct building and street number.  When I received notification that it was delivered, I immediately went to the wrong unit number thinking it was there, but it wasn't.  I even asked my neighbour if it came, but she stated it did not.  I contacted customer service and the first representative I spoke with refused to hear what I was telling her.  She insisted I check the lobby and other unit even though I stated I already had.  I checked the photo provided for proof of delivery and it wasn't even my building!  I have no clue where this building was (although I had an idea).  When I called again, the representative who answered was much more understanding and opened a case for me.  I received a call from FedEx, I was told it was delivered to the unit number from the address.  I informed him this was not the issue.  The issue was it was delivered to the wrong building.  This cleared up the confusion for him.When I did receive my package - finally - at the end of the day, the driver said the confusion had to do with the fact the wrong unit number was on the package.  No, the confusion was the package went to a completely wrong address.This is not the first time I've had issues with FedEx delivering packages to my residence.  The other instance had to do with the driver stating my address was not valid.

1,Any star is an exaggeration,"A one star rating is an exaggeration. On three different days I received an email stating my package would be delivered the following day however; it wasn’t.  After  waiting four additional days, I contacted  FedEx. 800-463-3339 on 11/14/2024, The first rep told me to hold while she checked the status and transferred me to a Spanish line. The 2nd rep (Chris) 7:18pm told me that my package was out on the truck and would arrive that evening by 8pm.  It did not.  The 3rd rep (Mary) did not want to take may complaint and tried to transfer me.  Finally, I was told that my package would be delivered by the post office because the FedEx Ground driver partners with the post office. Mary was unable to provide an explanation why FedEx would email updates on 3 different occasions that my package was coming the following day but didn’t. When a merchant drops off a package, the company knows the type of service they choose, so all these mistakes should not occur.   I also received texts messages that my package would be there by the end of the day.  That NEVER happened.  Due the value of the contents I took off a half a day twice to receive a package that never came.

1,The most frustrating experience in the shipping world,"So.. the best thing about using FedEx is the ease of access to the app. The app is an AMAZING idea. But as I've noticed, the shipping times/estimates/way of operation for this company is absolute garbage. I literally bought items that came in two boxes.. and for some lousy reason, they get separated and can't be BOTH delivered the same day. I've had other carriers deliver items with two separate packaging and they've always shown up on the estimated date and time. This has me questioning their preparation and logistics procedures. I've had 10+ packages that I've tracked with the app and NONE of them have ever been on time. There's always some type of delay no matter how perfect the weather is between carrier locations. If I had the actual option to choose a different package carrier (that had an easy access application) then I would gladly suggest a different company. I don't know how the supervision or any type of higher-ups within this company work, but they should really get a move on buttoning up their guidelines. I think it's ridiculous when a company claims how great they are on their website and they can never match that energy.","Nov 14, 2024",US

1,Persistent Billing for Undelivered Service and Poor Customer Support,"Review: I paid FedEx $53.10 for a temporary charge/hold on my credit card for a 2-day delivery service (FedEx 2Day AM) on October 27, 2024, which included an adult signature requirement for an urgent letter. I was informed by a FedEx employee that the company does not charge until the service is rendered. Despite providing the correct address, FedEx failed to deliver the letter and returned it to me without obtaining the required signature.Since then, FedEx has made multiple unauthorized attempts to charge my credit card for the undelivered service. I contacted customer service multiple times, but the issue remains unresolved. I was forced to lock my credit card to stop these billing attempts, causing significant financial disruption and stress.As a disabled veteran with PTSD and high blood pressure, the ongoing stress from these unauthorized billing attempts has negatively impacted my health. I have filed complaints with the Pennsylvania Attorney General and other consumer protection agencies, but FedEx has yet to address the issue.I am requesting that FedEx cancel the invoice, halt all billing attempts, and provide compensation for the distress caused by their mishandling of this case. It’s disappointing that a company known for reliability has failed to fulfill its service obligations and has mishandled customer support so poorly.","Nov 14, 2024",US

However, I got an email indicating that my order was arriving one day early. Great! I clicked on the FedEx tracking number, and indeed it indicated that my order would arrive on November 13th by end of day. Around 3:00pm today, November 13th, I checked the tracking again, and my order never indicated that it is out for delivery. I even used the FedEx chat to check on the order which said I should expect my order today. I decided to call their support because the online tracking never showed the order was out for delivery. Well low and behold, I was told that my order was never scheduled to be delivered today that it's scheduled for tomorrow by 5 pm. So basically FedEx lied when they said my order would arrive today. First of all I despise FedEx, they are the private sector equivalent to the USPS. A very poor run company, and from all the one star reviews I see here on Trustpilot, I know I'm right. So, I called Walmart Customer Service to informed them that FedEx actions will most likely cause me to never order online from them again. I don't need the aggravation.

I did not have a tracking number since the shipper closed my case after FedEx delivered my packages to the WRONG ADDRESS and refused to retrieve my packages and deliver them to my correct address. I don't have tracking numbers since I don't have the packages! The automated system at Fedex will hang up on you if you don't have the tracking numbers.

1,Lying drivers and poor delivery times,Two days service turns into ten day service. Driver claims no one was home despite the building having a porter.

1,FedEx's horrible delivery experience.,"FedEx really messed up here, when I ordered a bed frame from Bed Bath and Beyond, I put the address to my apartment, FedEx was supposed to deliver it to my apartment door, not the Management and Leasing Office. The problem is that this was a 52 lb package, which I cannot carry and drag down numerous amount of stairs, a package like that is too heavy for me and I am disabled. I am lucky that the staff to my apartment complex are so nice to help me, because FedEx didn't do anything to help. They just told me, ""we'll just mark it down that we will make sure that this won't happen again and we're sorry for the inconvenience."" That was a horrible experience that day and I dread if any package I order if it's a large package gets this carrier. UPS does their job to actually follow instructions and delivers to the address that is listed, even if it is a huge apartment complex, so why not FedEx? It's because they hire lazy delivery drivers that don't care what happens to people's packages or if a person can easily retrieve their package if it's larger than a small or medium package. Definitely the worst delivery carrier.","Nov 11, 2024",US
1,What’s the point of updates?,"An order from Target was given a time window for delivery 4 days ago. The package  still hasn’t been delivered. This was an emergency need that Target & Fedx initially showed as an overnight delivery. No updates.No communication. Zip. A delivery last Saturday was delivered 7 hrs after the window. I talked with the driver who said he was a contractor & only delivered to our address on Saturday. He was surprised Fedx gave a window since they don’t know his route. huh? So, does Fedx just throw a dart at a board to determine delivery times? What’s the point of having an app, or saying they update when they don’t? Why would any company use Fedx since it is so unreliable & doesn’t even follow through with what they post?","Nov 11, 2024",US

We removed the mailboxes weeks ago since postal lockers for the neighborhood were installed down the street.  She has decided that leaving our expensive packages behind the posts where the mailboxes used to be is the same as our front porch. She even lies and says in her report that the side of the street, where anything could be easily stolen or ruined by mud, rain and snow is leaving it on our front porch.  This is rediculous.  She knows this is completely unacceptable yet has done it at least 4 times now.  Amazon and UPS understand the difference between front porch and filthy ditch on the street.

1,FedEx demonstrates a lack of competence and appears to prioritize financial gain over service quality.,"I was expecting to receive my package today; however, it appears that there have been significant operational shortcomings with FedEx. The process of transferring packages from transport trucks to delivery vehicles is not being executed efficiently. It is concerning to observe that management may not be effectively addressing these issues, resulting in lower standards of service. It is my belief that a thorough investigation into FedEx's practices is warranted to understand the underlying causes of these persistent problems. Additionally, the possibility of a class-action lawsuit should be considered. Earlier today, I spoke with a customer service representative who assured me that my package would be on the delivery truck today, despite the fact that deliveries typically do not occur in the afternoon if the package has not already been loaded onto the truck. Upon calling back, a subsequent representative provided more accurate information, indicating that the delivery would not take place until Tuesday due to the federal holiday. This experience raises concerns regarding the level of training and competency among staff, as well as a lack of transparency in communications. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss these issues directly with senior management, including the CEO, to understand how such operational deficiencies can persist and to emphasize the importance of customer service in maintaining a reputable business. The prioritization of profit over service often leads to a decline in overall company performance.","Nov 10, 2024",US

However, it is now 11/09/2024, and the package still hasn’t been delivered.Despite contacting customer service and receiving case number C-166****, I have not received any updates or resolution.

I expected better service for such time-sensitive, important documentation. Please ensure this package is delivered promptly, as the impact of this delay has already been substantial.Yesterday I contacted FedEx customer service once again and spoke with a representative who informed me that the package is considered “lost” but then abruptly ended the call.

1,Customer support is a disaster,"How can a globally operating company like FedEx be such a disaster with their customer support?Here’s the situation:1. I received a package from Hong Kong, paid a hefty customs fee — all fine.2. The product didn’t meet my expectations, so I returned it. The company I bought from provided and prepaid a return label.3. The package was picked up ""for free"", 4. later that week FedEx charged me €330 — wrongfully — despite the prepaid label.Since then, getting this €330 refunded has been a nightmare. I’ve made countless inquiries, only to receive generic, auto-responses. Every attempt to reach an actual human has hit a brick wall. Here’s what I’ve encountered:• The hotline connects me to a virtual assistant who just cycles through automated responses.• For over three weeks, every attempt to speak to a real person has ended with: “Customer support is experiencing high demand, please call back later.”• I’ve submitted four support forms, tried calling at different times — and still, no resolution or even a single person looking into this issue.This process has been incredibly time-consuming and frustrating, all for a simple refund that should never have been charged in the first place. FedEx, it’s time to take a hard look at your customer support process. A global brand should not operate like this. Just imagine a small or midsized company would operate this way...Would appreciate if someone from FedEx help resolve this.","Nov 6, 2024",DE

When I called a few days later, I was informed that the investigation was closed and that I would have to contact the shipper (vineyard) in Italy for it to file a claim on my behalf. With the 9 hour time difference, it took a few days to reach the winery.  Although the vineyard agreed to reach out the shipper, I was informed that the winery was now sold out of the wine we had ordered but failed to receive.  In the meantime, Federal Express has done NOTHING to remedy this situation.  Yes, I paid for the wine and for the shipping but I apparently have NO rights to even file a claim here!

Two years ago my security camera captured a FedEx driver delivering a bicycle to my porch which I had special ordered.  He immediately turned around and returned to his truck with the bicycle .

I have been trying to get my account deleted; for eight days now. I have 4 emails saying that my account has been deleted and have made at least 8 calls to do the same. However; I can still log in and have a registered online account. The latest 5th email told me that my account has been closed and that I needed to contact online services; yet another phone number, to close my online services. I tried today at 3:24pm Pacific and the online office is closed and I have to try during their normal business hours. There is no reference to which time zone or hours they keep. There is no ""online services"" way to deliver my request online. This is absolutely insane. I am sure that Beware FedEx Part 3 is coming....","Oct 31, 2024",US

1,"FedEx, The Republic of Georgia","FedEx, The Republic of Georgia – I shipped a package from the US to the country of Georgia. I was instructed to pay customs of 300 Lari ($110.00). With the aid of my Georgian bank, I sent my payment. We had to complete the process seven times before we were able to get the transaction to successfully be completed. Once completed the customs agent told me I must pay an additional 173.27 Lari ($63.00), she did not explain what this fee was for but I paid it anyway. At this point the customs agent explained that I placed my Tax ID number in the wrong field. After consulting with my bank, I was informed that there was no other available field (on the software interface) to enter this tax ID, other than the field used. I had the same problem when I made the second payment through my banking APP.Next, I contacted FedEx, USA. The US based customer service refuses to take action on FedEx offices in foreign countries. I reminded the customer service agents that the FedEx brand was traded on a US stock market and was headquartered in the US. At this point they would hang-up on me.Finally, I called my mail forwarding company Traveling Mailbox, since they completed the paperwork to ship the package but they were unable to provide any assistance and my package remains in the status of “uncleared customs”.  The customer service agents at FedEx Georgia, just repeat like a robot that I have to pay customs. I even physical visited the FedEx office in Tbilisi, Georgia but they refused to speak to me. I have submitted a lengthy letter to FedEx Manager in Tbilisi, Georgia. I have not received a reply.","Updated Nov 3, 2024",GE

Unfortunately one doesn’t know that FedEx will (not) be delivering, when you place an order online with retailers, until after you receive an order confirmation. Then the dreaded “track your order” arrives in your inbox from FedEx and you can watch live as the calamity unfolds. If you have a choice…. DON’T. Being located quite remotely, we have our fair share of botched deliveries, but I have genuinely never had a successful delivery via FedEx. Interestingly, the previous (non)delivery from early September is still showing on their app as “on its way” … FedEx customer services tell me it can’t say that as all undelivered parcels are returned to the sender …..","Oct 30, 2024",GB

I asked him why would he put on the sticker that I wasn’t here when he didn’t even get out the car and come to the door. He said he was trained to do it that way. I am fed up with this company.

Oh, package was lost. No, package was stolen by these sticky finger drivers and nothing ever happens to them. It must be part of the hiring process. Being a thief must be a requirement to work for FedEx. I have actually had to track these drivers down with my drone and ask for my package and they claim they don't have it. Just look at all these reviews, something needs to change. I have video surveillance of these drivers pulling onto my property, doing U-turns and just leaving without even getting out of the truck and putting ""attempted delivery "" in the notes. As far as ""LOSING"" packages goes, this is not what's happening. These drivers will meet with friends and family members in Walmart parking lots or secluded places and give the packages to them. They look up the address of the shipper on the package and they'll research what type of company it is and what type of merchandise they sell. Anyone can do this. I will be stopping this driver the next time I see him!","Updated Oct 26, 2024",US

Same thing on Monday and Tuesday. The vineyard got involved and told FedEx to return the package to them and they are processing a new order to be delivered to a pick up station next Wednesday. I gave FedEx a rating of 2 because we will assume some responsibility because of missing their first delivery attempt although they did not come close to their delivery window. The bigger problem is their poor communication or lack of communication and their inability to make additional attempts even though they said they would. Going forward, any wine deliveries will go to a FedEx pick up location and hope this eliminates future problems. This delivery was to Arizona and heat and wine can cause problems.

Some of the staff ""tried"" to help and speed up the process, like Bianca, however others, like Agnes, told me that ""their only job is to pick it up"", the rest I had to deal with myself. Didn't try calling FedEx, transferring me at least, nothing. FedEx has money-back guarantee, but when you try to claim it on their website, the site crashes. Their chat option doesn't work, there is no phone number or email listed anywhere, and when I did finally find an email to contact after hours of looking, they have not gotten back to me after a month. Terrible experience overall, will never deal with them again.","Oct 21, 2024",CA

1,DO NOT ORDER FROM COMPANIES USING FEDEX,"Fed ex laid off 1500+ express drivers and has outsourced those deliveries to local ""Ground"" drivers. It is a complete and total quagmire and for anyone who lives rurally as I do, packages are no longer being delivered. At all. I have had 4 packages returned to sender in the last 2 weeks because the driver refuses to drive to where I live. And on the tracking, they list ""recipient refused delivery!"" That is some class A BS right there! And speaking of outsourcing, they have outsourced their customer service to India where they pay reps a dollar a day to read from a script and regurgitate the information that's available with online tracking. When I finally asked for and spoke to a 'supervisor' he put me on hold, contacted the local carrier, updated the address to a town address to make delivery easier for the driver, and noted my account. Except, he didn't.  When my order was still not delivered to the new address, I 1. called the FedEx customer service in India again, only to find out that there was no update to the address nor any note on my account that I had called to request a new delivery address, and 2. I (after an incredible amount of research to find the number) contacted the local carrier who confirmed that they had not received any update at all from FedEx. As of this moment, I still haven't received my order, but I am trusting that the person I spoke with has actually addressed it with the driver. Additionally, when I realized I was missing another package that I had ordered a month ago, I discovered that for the last 3 weeks, the FedEx driver has been submitting that I am refusing the delivery and now that shipment is being returned to sender as well! Most retailers have a ""shipping"" link in their website footers. Before you order ANYTHING, check to see who the carrier is and if it is FedEx, I highly recommend you contact their customer service to see if there is another option for delivery, and if not, boycott retailers who are using FedEx. You may not have these issues if you don't live rurally, but for the sake of decency and basic respect for customers, find a better way!","Oct 18, 2024",US

That BS because the weather was great. I asked for the manager. He refused and said the manager will tell me the same thing. Then he hung up. I had two FedEx deliveries from Yakima Washington this week that sat in the local shop because they claimed my home address was wrong. It wasn’t. That was a whopper. He claimed that the address was wrong so they sat in the local office without trying another delivery. Then they sent both packages back.

1,I have to use this sorry excuse of a…,"I have to use this sorry excuse of a shipping service for my place of employment. Due to us being a start-up business, we had to use it because of costs but now that we’re expanding, I’m hoping to stop using it soon altogether. We ship medical devices for oral surgeries including dental prostheses and surgical components. I can not tell you how many times they’ve lost our products and since we as a company can’t pay for full insurance on our shipments, we basically only get about $100 back off of a product that takes $1,000+ to fabricate. Also the website is actual dogsh*t and never works the way it’s supposed to. It’s crazy to me how a business that works internationally still seems to running their servers on windows 7 and maybe even older. Filing claims is a chore and when they add new stuff to their website, they don’t even bother removing the outdated versions so I’m basically flip-flopping to different versions of the same website that makes me login every single time.","Oct 15, 2024",US

1,Never use FedEx,"Never use FedEx!  Appalling and deceitful service that fails to meet its advertised claims.  They should add “ly Bad” to the end of their advertised strapline “Promise: ‘I will make every FedEx experience outstanding”. Incredibly difficult to get hold of the representatives who can actually help customers.   Courier lied about trying to deliver.   Twice this month, we have had extremely important documents sent from the USA which needed to arrive ‘next day’  after being sent.   On both occasions, the documents sent were required to complete an important and very time sensitive transaction.     On both occasions we received notification from FedEx that delivery had been attempted but no recipient was present. This was a lie since the property is never left empty and the recipients were watching and listening out for the courier.  On the second occasion - today - ,the recipient posted notes on every single door explaining that the recipient was present and if no one answered the door (highly unlikely) to please call various numbers. At no point were FedEx able to provide evidence that courier had actually been present.  Subsequently,  after lying about attempted deliveries, FedEx then delayed delivery until the following day which would’ve meant that the documents would not have been available for the scheduled meeting with lawyers. On the last occasion, the only way that we could get hold of the documents in time for the meeting the following day,  was to send one of the recipients, an 89 year-old man,  on a 1 1/2 hour round trip journey to the depot.   This  particular delivery (sent fromNew York on a Friday) had been scheduled for delivery on Monday between 8.20am and 12.20am and the document was recorded as being returned to the depot (40 minutes away) at 11 am.   However, we didn’t get notified of this and nor was it on the tracking system until I spoke to a call handler at 15.00 that same day.  It was very difficult to get hold of anyone in person.   When we did,  there was complete refusal to deliver the documents on the scheduled day.   There was also confusion about how late the depot was open .   To add insult to injury , just after this 89 year old man had completed the 1 hour 20 minute round trip to the depot,  I finally received notification that the ‘parcel had been delivered’.   A disgraceful,  uncaring, insensitive performance.  A  Cclassic example of an organisation putting their corporate profits above the needs and concerns of the people who use their service.","Oct 15, 2024",GB

Went to my front door only to find another notice stating they made a delivery attempt. Totally pissed off now that I waited and there was no ringing of the doorbell when they arrived. I call back and was told because it's an overnight delivery they would make another attempt today and would give me an update. By 3pm still no message so I called and was told that it would be delivered on Monday. So I have wasted an entire day just to be told I  could drive a half hour and pick it up myself today.

Late afternoon, I check to see why package is not delivered and it has been changed to Monday instead. This is unacceptable to me. From online search all Fed-ex deliveries take place on Saturday and Sunday also as well as Mon-Fri. Fed-ex is the last choice of my delivery service, and I wish more companies offered an alternate shipper with a lot better service. Sitting on my package an extra three days is what I call bad service no matter who the delivery service is. Do your job you get paid to do, keep your customers happy deliver the package they are waiting on. The 2-day service from FedEx is bogus.

1,FedEx provided The Worst customer…,"FedEx provided The Worst customer service with the exception of one individual.  FedEx ""Customer Service"" via 1 (800) 463-3339 is absolutely terrible and not at all helpful. The agent just kept repeating an apology and giving reasons why he could not do anything about an 80 lb. package being left at the bottom of the stairs where it could have gotten rained on, instead of at my door.  I am 74 years old and physically unable to take anything that heavy up the stairs. Next, when I spoke to the man in FedEx ""Escalations"" he did the same thing. Just kept repeating ""I'm sorry etc."" and saying they cannot contact the truck driver!  Like it isn't a FedEx issue at all. Ridiculous. He refused to let me speak to anyone else when I requested it. So, I drove across town to the FedEx Express office and actually got real help from M. She was helpful, courteous, understanding and kind. She called Topeka FedEx and asked them to send out someone to get the package to my door. There was no definite answer that that would be done since the supervisor was in a meeting.  So I waited. When I placed my order for the item in the package I was not given the option to write instructions for delivery. Another instance of poor customer service. When I called the vendor the agent told me, ""I'm going to be honest. This happens all the time with FedEx.""A few hours later, God blessed me with a young neighbor who tapped on my door and offered to bring the package up the stairs for me.  Awesome, thoughtful and kind of him!But sadly, my FedEx nightmare was not over because I called the Topeka Ground office to tell them they did not need to come because a kind neighbor had brought up the package. Unfortunately, I spoke to L. who had a great interest in quoting FedEx policy to me about a few things including re: female delivery staff and heavy packages. If the delivery person thinks it's too heavy they can skip taking it to the customer's door.  If FedEx does not want female employees to hurt themselves lifting packages that are too heavy then why put those packages on her truck?  And what is the customer supposed to do? And why would someone in ""customer service"" lecture me about FedEx policy instead of simply thanking me for calling to save a FedEx employee the extra trip?  I could have chosen to treat FedEx staff they way I'd been treated throughout the day (with the exception of M.) and just let someone make a senseless trip to my address. But M. had left me with a good feeling so I called.  And then L. ruined my improved impression by her FedEx-righteous speech and a very clear desire to ""set me straight."" Garbage.  I mean REALLY:  three out of four FedEx workers were not at all helpful and rudely repeated canned ""policy"" which was very obviously and very deliberately designed to leave a customer with nothing. Why on earth should any customer care about policy when service has sunk that low?  Wake up FedEx.","Oct 11, 2024",US

It’s best to become your own delivery services if you have no choice but to go through FedEx. Don’t trust that they will meet delivery quotas as promised. Pick it up “Directly” from FedEX. If you do have a delivery option choose “Amazon” I promise you way less of a headache and they delivery on time and as promised or your money back guaranteed.

1,Pathetic and unprofessional to the…,"Pathetic and unprofessional to the core..FEDEX AND TNT are one company and they lost my valuable documents which I sent to the passport office. This will cause me huge problems. I paid a lot for their express courier service and they told me they guarante the delivery within  2 to 3 days to the destination in another country. Now that almost a week elapsed and they did not deliver my letter, they tell me that they only guarantee delivery to the destination country but not to the actual address where it should be delivered (!) What's the point of this guarantee, one wonders? This means they only guarantee to deliver a letter to the airport in another country and leave it there. I can not even receive any compensation for the expense I had and the huge damage they caused me by losing my letter. Totally unprofessional, avoid using them at all cost.","Oct 9, 2024",RS
1,The driver left a neighbor's envelope…,The driver left a neighbor's envelope and I thought it was for me... No glasses on... When I opened it there were two credit cards. I called FedEx talked with two people in the Philippines one was a supervisor who said he would email me a pick up time for FedEx to come. That never happened. I called the FedEx station two towns over... And the answering system would not let me speak to anyone... Same on the national number. It was not my package and they have no mechanism in place for that. Finally I called the originating FedEx number and the recording said it could not receive messages. So I went to my police station and they took the envelope with the cards and made a report. FedEx cannot expect people to assume responsibility for their mistakes.,"Oct 9, 2024",US

You quite simply can not rely on them to deliver your parcel on time, sometimes even failing to deliver on the day they said it would be with you. Do yourself a favour. Let them come and go with your parcel as they please, as they will.Then wait for them to finish all their delivery attempts so you can just go and pick it up from whichever depot they decide to leave it at.In my younger years I bought puff from street dealers with better punctuality.","Oct 9, 2024",GB
1,Shockingly poor customer service,"Absolutely terrible to deal with, I had been expecting an item from EU for which customs had supposedly been included in delivery fee, however, sadly not the case.  Paid the invoice after some too-ing and fro-ing only for the item to be returned to sender!!  Still can't get a refund for this rather expensive item as its now stuck in customs at the other end - and apparently nobody at FedEx can do a single thing to help, despite the fact that this is their error. Now having an absolute nightmare trying to get a refund for the customs fees I paid and yet again absolutely nobody you contact can help, its forever a 'different department but they don't have a direct number'.  Lost count of the number of times I have been 'assured' I will be called back regarding the issue. And to top it all, a fitting testament of just how embarrassingly poor the service is, I got home last night to an invoice for the £136 I have already paid (a fortnight ago!) waiting for me on the doormat, yesterday was the 8th October and the invoice was sent on 23rd September.  Says it all really! Avoid at all costs!","Oct 9, 2024",GB
1,Every is completely wrong,"I bought a watch in Japan. The 26th of July, I got a call from FedEx to clear the goods and that I had to send the invoice related to the watch. I also asked the person on the phone, how the payment of the custom declaration can be paid. She told me I will get an invoice about one week after the delivery and I can transfer the money. The watch should have been delivered the 29Th of July but FedEx called it off early that day (it is not like I have unlimited home office days, but ok). The 30th I got a call from FedEx that the courier would deliver the goods in one or two hours and that I had to pay the invoice to him. Of course, no payment by card or PayPal and the courier had no change. I got a receipt for the custom declaration. The 8th of August, I got an invoice from FedEx to clear the custom declaration that I have already paid. By the way, FedEx has charged €10 more for its incompetence to compare with the original invoice. The 9th of August, I contacted FedEx and chatted with a bot that didn’t answer my inquiry because I have already paid, it also fand the original receipt and amount. I filed a complaint for the accounting. The form is rubbish and it is impossible to upload documents or write in details the matter. On the original invoice there is also no invoice number just the shipping number. According to FedEx, I should have got an answer after 10 days and before 14 days, that didn’t happen. The 23rd of August, I contacted FedEx again by phone, first it was a bot that didn’t understand the matter, I insisted to speak with a human being. The person at the phone started an escalation of my complaint and told me I should file a second one and gave me the email address of the accounting department. I submitted a second complaint. The 26th of August, I got a terribly formulated answer that the second invoice has been cleared, with of course no excuse, why it should be. I have never received an answer for the second complaint.","Oct 9, 2024",DE

One month later I had still not received the books so contacted the sender who contacted Fedex, she was notified that the parcel has been sent back to sender as they had tried to deliver the parcel 3 times and nobody was home. This is not true as I work from home and my office looks out to our drive and I have a ring camera and no fedex delivery has been attempted at this property. They said they were trying to call me again not true because they were not supplied with my phone number or email. I have called fedex customerservice 4 times on each occasion I have been told someone would contact me by 5pm that day nobody does, then when I contact them (usually on the phone between 30 and 40 minutes) I get the run around saying they have a wrong number for me even though each time I call I give them the phone number again and ask them to say it back to me. I have asked to speak to someone who can resolve this but am being told by customer service that this is not possible.

2,FedEx did a deficient job when.,"FedEx did a deficient job when delivering my package and handling the customer service side of things when my package got stolen.  FedEx is substandard as they do not send you a text message when packages are delivered or at least I did not get a text. If I had I could have left the office or sent a friend to go get it. This is the first grievance I have because this is the first reason my package was stolen. The second reason my package was stolen is that when the delivery person said it was left at my door the image sent shows it was clearly left at the gate and not the door, providing the possibility of the package getting stolen and making the odds higher. My next grievance is not only did FedEx enable my package in getting stolen, but when I inquired with Jesse at the Norman branch address 1650 24th Ave NW. He simply told me that refunds do not go through FedEx but with the seller that part made sense he was unfeeling and unwilling to help just saying anything to get me out of the store is what made me upset.","Oct 7, 2024",US
5,FED-EXcellent!! 8912 Pineville-Matthews Rd.,"On September 23, 2024, it was crunch time and my colleague and I were out of options for printing a major presentation in our Charlotte office due to an inoperable printer, and had to look for outside assistance, and just like that, with no hesitation, FedEx at 8912 Pineville-Matthews Rd saved the day!! Jenifer Aschenbrener (store mgr) took our project on top of the hustle and bustle that was going on in her store. At first, she wasn't aware of how large and tedious the project was because she was called by another FedEx store (who was a little too busy to handle our project but thank you!), thinking she needed to print only a few copies of a page that was provided to her while we were enroute to the Pineville store. When we arrived and told Jenifer what we REALLY needed, she didn't say no, instead, she enlisted the help of Dina Hagstrom (associate) and they went all in! Please believe me when I say these two ladies gave 200% of themselves when working on our project. They both are champions, but I have to give a little bit more credit to Dina, who stayed until the final page was printed, which was 8:30 pm, and they closed at 7:00 pm (yes, I said 7:00 pm!). My colleague and I were in awe of the customer service and dedication they put towards our project, AND on top of this, Jenifer blessed us with a national discount, YEEEESSS, it's true!! My colleague and I happily commend these two ladies for their efforts. Jenifer and Dina, YOU'RE SIMPLY THE BEST!! FedEx got it right when they hired the two of you. We also want to thank the other young lady who worked that shift with them that evening, and my sincere apologies for not getting your name, but she took on additional responsibilities while Jenifer and Dina saved us, so I happily commend her as well! FedEx got it right when they hired that ENTIRE SHIFT that was there to assist us that day.

1,FedUp,"*click* “Your order has been submitted. Thank you. Check here for tracking details.” *click*………oh no…no..no God no!….NOOOO! The package is being delivered by FedEx.This is my average response when I order something online and find out that FedEx will be logistically responsible for handling my package. I’d rather receive a prompt saying that my package will be hand delivered by a hitchhiker from California. I expect FedEx to deliver packages flawlessly to my residence like I expect to order a McFlurry at McDonald’s and they respond with “OK”. It’s just not gonna happen. We all know that McDonald’s ice cream machine is “broken” just like we all know FedEx in some shape or form will inevitably disappoint you. I want to believe that they’ll get better. That they’ll read these horrible reviews and say “ hey guys, did y’all know that we REALLY suck? We should try to improve literally anything.” But they don’t. I remember my parents complaining about FedEx when I was just a young lad.I write this review as a culmination of a generational distaste of the shipping and receiving giant that is FedEx. Today I received that package that I ordered this time last month. Like I said I don’t expect exceptional service from this company, but after today I just felt inclined to leave a review. I received a text from FedEx yesterday saying to expect my package to arrive today. I was excited to see that it would finally arrive. I clicked on the link for tracking and I saw options saying if I wouldn’t be home I could schedule it to be delivered to the shipping center and pick it up. My take from that was that maybe someone would need to be home, maybe they would need a signature? I told my wife to expect the package to arrive today. This afternoon I received a picture from my wife of a cardboard box sitting maybe a foot away from the street in my front yard. “Noo haha that can’t be how they delivered it. Maybe they delivered it to a neighbor accidentally and the neighbor put it there, I don’t know.”I clicked the link on my text that said that my package had been delivered. That link brought me directly to a picture taken by the FedEx driver of my delivered package.  Sure enough, it was a picture resembling the picture I had received from my wife a few minutes earlier. As I gazed upon the picture, I imagined what a miserable experience this poor package must have endured. About how it was probably recklessly thrown or kicked from truck to truck, or how it was probably lost a number of times through out its journey. And finally as it reached its destination, it was thrown on the ground in a fashion that I imagine would be similar to a NFL wide receiver celebrating a touchdown. A tear rolled down my face as I exited the browser.When I arrived home, I carefully opened the package to examine the shoes inside, half expecting them to have been previously worn. To my surprise they were unblemished and in good condition. It just blows my mind that FedEx finds it acceptable to just leave packages at the side of the road. Maybe this is their new process for trying to keep delivery times on track. Maybe the delivery driver was a retired paperboy who couldn’t give up old habits. Or maybe they are trying to be more hospitable to porch pirates, so they don’t even need to leave their vehicle to steal packages. Whatever it is, their quality of service never ceases to amaze me. I just wish FedEx would take a page out of the Port workers playbook and go on strike. Demand higher wages for their exceptional service and wait for their ridiculous demands to be met. Meanwhile, UPS could increase their fleet and do what they do best.FedEx, I don’t know your mission statement, your goals, or why you still exist as a company, but I do hope that one day you realize just how horrible you are at your job.P.S. Thank you TrustPilot for giving me a platform and avenue to voice my opinion on this terrible company.","Oct 4, 2024",US

1,Can't hold location or add delivery instruction on website,"I live in an apartment and fedex would never search the intercom for my name. So no matter how many times they deliver, they can't get to me. And I can't add delivery instruction either. They want me to confirm address and would always tell me my address is wrong even though I typed in the same address as shown on shipment. So I can't add delivery instruction... They also had an option to create an account which need a 6 digits code that they will mail to me via physical mail, which took weeks. I believe 3 weeks. I put in the code, they verified my address, but any shipments I'm expecting connected to the same email address don't show up. So I have ""no shipments"". I also cannot tell them to hold at a location. Because then I would have to log in. Once I log in, there would be NO SHIPMENTS under my account!!! Or they won't let me log in, saying my password is wrong. So I click forget password and they don't send me the email to reset password. F ing FEDEX won't let me add delivery instruction, won't let me hold at location, won't deliver. WHAT THE FFFFFF!!!!????!!!??? It's like the employees deliberately do this because they're pissed you have packages and they are probably too underpaid to order any. Don't hire 3rd world people because your service is crap. I always dread when place I ordered from have fedex to delivery my package. Other delivery companies never had this problem. Other companies always dial intercom, call from external phone to get buzzer code, or leave a notice to pick up at a nearby location. Fedex just don't deliver at all.

I filed a complaint on the driver….. my next order of a case of can food was thrown out on the side of the road a 1/4 mile down from my house. If I hadn’t gone to town that day I never would have found it. This past week I’ve had $110 worth of can food supposedly delivered to me but it wasn’t. Either the driver delivered to someone else or is STEALING. This is not any fault of Chewy….its all on FedEx. I don’t know if their employees are illiterate or just thieving a-holes but nothing has been done to resolve this. I feel they owe me $110 and the driver needs to be terminated.

Then Tracking Note  almost gave me a heart attack - ""Customer not available or business closed"" (5 pm).Furious, I called their cust. service line, this time I managed to reach a real agent, not caught in the number selection maize. After lengthy explanation & repeating, the Agent finally realized the delivery address (with unit #) was a residential building and they had neglected to get an intercom number (since their drivers not allowed to phone or text to connect to customer!).

I just received the empty box.,I have been trying to get in touch with FedEx since May I ordered a Apple Watch. The Apple Watch total price was $461. I waited patiently for this watch because my daughter was graduated from college. I received a notification from Ring that somebody was on my porch and it was a FedEx driver dropping off a box that was open. You can see the tape hanging from the box now when have you ever known for FedEx to just drop off an expensive package saying that you have to sign for the delivery driver as he’s dropping off the empty box I disputed it with Best Buy. The driver took a picture that he dropped the package off at my front door . I have the ring notification video and Best Buy told me that was nothing that they could do. I cancel my account with Best Buy because they are very unprofessional and they did not look into it. I am on my second dispute with Apple because I use my Apple credit card to purchase this watch.

1,Horrible Service and Utter…,"Horrible Service and Utter Disappointment - Zero StarsIf you're considering sending your packages through FedEx, think twice. My experience with their service has been nothing short of frustrating and disappointing. FedEx has failed to deliver my package on multiple occasions, despite numerous assurances from their customer service that it would arrive on specific dates. Each time, I was left waiting, only to receive a notification that the delivery had been rescheduled—without any valid explanation.What makes matters worse is their customer service. When you call for assistance, you are met with representatives who might as well be automated responses. Their job seems to be simply relaying whatever information the system gives them, such as ""your shipment is scheduled to be delivered on this date"" or, more often, ""there is no update on your shipment, we will notify you by text or email."" Expressing your frustration, as I did, gets you nowhere. They repeat the same lines over and over, offering no real solutions or escalation to a manager or supervisor who could actually help. It feels like you're not talking to real people who are genuinely concerned with helping you.Customer service is supposed to be about active listening, understanding customer concerns, and going the extra mile to resolve issues. Unfortunately, this is not what you get with FedEx. Please, save yourself the time, energy, and emotional stress. After contacting the sender of my package and searching for places to leave a review, I was not surprised to see the overwhelming number of one-star reviews and similar complaints about FedEx.Learn from my experience: If you value timely and reliable service, look elsewhere. I sincerely hope my review helps others avoid the same situation I faced.","Sep 27, 2024",CA

They didn't slow down, texting they'll try again tomorrow. I called the 1 800 number to have the driver turn around, but they aren't ""dispatch"". I had to go online and fill out forms to have them hold it so I can pick it up.

I emailed FedEx as their customer service dept was closed. The letter was dated 02/09/2024 and stated I had 14 days to pay or extra charges would be incurred. I received the letter on 14/09/2024, basically taking up my 14 days to pay. I have since raised the issue with control account and they have just sent me the original bill from FedEx (which I’ve not seen before). At this time I also received a second letter from control account with £25 additional charges. Again this letter was dated much earlier than when it was received. Once I stated this with controlaccount, I have not had a response back. I have now paid the additional bill just to stop more charges.

I have watched my package not come to Tampa not once but twice and one of those facilites is 1.7 miles from my home. Then watched them send my package to Ocala and then to Orlando and state they are not sure why my item has not been delivered and can take up to 4 to 6 weeks to deliver. How is this great service how this even service at all. Then not to be able to speak to a supervisor or other leadership due to the agent is unwilling or able to transfer. What horrible customer service and dedication to  assist the customer. Now I will forever see fedex is not for the people but for the ceo who doesn’t care for the consumer or their employees. In my book I would never use you again and find alternate services and never recommend anyone to use. Not even my personal business.,"Sep 26, 2024",US

I encountered an issue with my shipment and reached out to their customer service for assistance, but the representative was unhelpful and seemed uninterested in resolving my problem. When I asked to provide feedback through their survey, I was put on hold instead of being connected, which felt like an intentional attempt to silence my concerns. It’s incredibly disappointing to see a company of this size provide such poor support to its customers. I expected much better from FedEx, and I hope they take steps to improve their customer service. Unfortunately, I can’t recommend them based on this experience.","Sep 26, 2024",CA

All of the above. How is this company still in business when they have ratings lower (by a long shot!) than Congress and the Supreme Court? It it were once in a while or due to a storm or natural disaster in California, I might be able to understand. But it's consistent no matter where the shipment is originating, although CA is particularly bad. Maybe they should put down the joint and do their jobs out there.","Sep 25, 2024",US

I'm not sitting in all day waiting, I have a job too. Nowhere does it state this delivery needs to be signed for. Get another email saying ""sorry we've missed you"". Are you serious? There's literally a car port, a double garage, a back gate and neighbours...Could your brainless driver not have left it in one of those safe places??? Can they think for themselves??? Then I try to manage the delivery through the email I received and it doesn't work, so I can't tell them to leave it in a safe place, or with a neighbour. Can't contact them through live chat either, and I don't have all day to sit on the phone talking to someone of no help. Absolute worst delivery company.","Sep 25, 2024",GB

1,Seeing their overall review ranking,"Seeing their overall review ranking, how long are these people even still operating in business? I had the worst shipping experience in my entire life with FedEx in like 2018 I had sold an apple phone and apple watch online and then right after I dropped off the items to be shipped. I realize that the guy had not actually sent payment but they were closed by then until I just told them go ahead and keep the shipping fee just don’t ship my items I’ll come tomorrow morning and get them. The clerk at the store assured me that was fine and then next day arrives and I go to get them and they tell me the stuff have been shipped. But it was still at the sorting facility in Sioux City so I reached out to them and whoever I talk to it was a female told me that they can’t just let me come get it and return it. They said the only thing they can do is let it run the course of the mail route like try to deliver it and if it don’t, then it will come back after it’s undeliverable or whatever and they end up delivering my stuff to the guy committing fraud. They even managed to collect his signature.Well, this time what’s going on? It’s pretty much the same except I’m kind of on the other end. I placed the order on Amazon. It was five items total four or five in the order. I honestly would not have even placed the order if I had seen FedEx anywhere.. so I’m an Amazon prime member and I’m supposed to get Fast two day shipping but it’s been six days total at least. Originally, when I reached out to FedEx on the phone, I found out that they have the most terrible horrible phone system ever made. You gotta say something else about 20 or 30 times before you get humans. And then when you finally get a rep on the phone, they act like they can’t do anything and they just try to get you off the phone. They won’t reach out to anything matter fact, they told me or they can’t reach the driver. But you know I’m  smart and they are an international logistics company with all kinds of money and resources and you want to expect me to believe that once you put a package on the truck and depart that it’s out of your hands. FedEx has no control over ? If you expect me to believe that you cannot reroute or intercept an item or even contact Driver? they says They attempted to deliver it three times but they’ve never been here once. As a matter of fact, when I track the package on their site location, clearly states Ames and it’s never went any further than that and that is not The shipping address for this item or this order I should say.  Seriously at this point like FedEx sucks so bad that I’ll get angry just even thinking about having to use them. And I’m canceling my Amazon prime membership immediately too because this is way way over past two days. Honestly, unless one of them finds a way to make it up to me. I am the type of stubborn and loyal person that I’ll never spend a single penny for the rest of my life on either their businesses.. I’ll give you more than that I’ll encourage everybody else not to spend money  too.When it became apparent m Mismanagement occurs at every level and FedEx so I contacted Amazon because even if they’re not the ones who sent it it’s their platform and prime has the shipping guarantee. The Amazon rep didn’t seem to be able to do anything either and it’s his damn madness she tried to blame blame us on some ““ third-party seller first of all what in the hell is that and what’s that got to do with anything? I don’t care if he’s a party seller if he sold that stuff on their platform then Amazon shares responsibility plus they failed to meet their guarantee with this. I want immediate refund, I’m so mad. I’m ready to go discourage other people from shopping with because I’m so angry.   What bothers me the most out of this whole thing is how FedEx is so easy able to lie about attempted deliveries and how they get away with like this ridiculous nonsense and nothing ever happens.There’s no felony for Mike. I don’t know delivery lies or delivery fraud.?","Sep 25, 2024",US

I tried to file a new missing package claim but discovered I could no longer verify my address. I believe this is because FedEx changed it in their system to prevent me from filing a claim for a refund.Given the state of FedEx reviews, I should have known better than to buy from a company that uses FedEx.

When I called the number, the person insisted that they would have given me a tracking number when the voicemail I have gives me no such information. They could not proceed unless they had a tracking number. I hope whatever was trying to be delivered wasn't important, because it will surely be sent back. Useless driver, useless FedEx rep that called me, and useless support. No redeeming factors here.","Sep 23, 2024",US

1,The Impact of Job Denial Based on…,"The Impact of Job Denial Based on Background ChecksIn today’s competitive job market, individuals must navigate not only their skills and qualifications but also the implications of their pasts as judged by prospective employers. Recently, I faced the disappointment of being denied a job that I believed I was well-qualified for, despite having not been in any trouble for the past five years. This experience has highlighted the issues around background checks in hiring practices, particularly the challenges faced by individuals with past issues yet who are striving to lead responsible and productive lives.The incident that led to my denial of employment stemmed from a background check that revealed my prior issues, which, while serious at the time, I have worked hard to overcome. Recognizing the significance of my past, I have dedicated myself to personal growth and rehabilitation. I have attended numerous workshops, engaged in community service, and maintained stable employment since those troubled times. Therefore, the company's decision felt particularly unjust as I have proven my commitment to turning my life around.What makes the situation more disheartening is observing others, perhaps with similar or even worse backgrounds, being granted opportunities at that same organization. This inconsistency raises questions about the fairness of the hiring process. The criteria for employment should ideally focus on an applicant's current capabilities and potential, rather than being solely dependent on previous missteps. In my case, the lack of transparency regarding the selection process and the criteria used to evaluate candidates has left me feeling discouraged and marginalized.In a work environment where diverse backgrounds can contribute to a more innovative and dynamic culture, it is crucial for employers to recognize the potential of individuals seeking redemption. Recent studies have shown that companies that embrace candidates with diverse experiences, including those who have made mistakes in their past, often benefit from increased loyalty and a richer workplace culture. By refusing to engage with applicants who have shown they can learn and grow from their experiences, organizations are potentially missing out on valuable contributions.Moreover, the stigma associated with past mistakes perpetuates a cycle of disadvantage. When individuals who are eager to work and contribute to society are repeatedly denied opportunities, it can lead to feelings of hopelessness and the perpetuation of negative behaviors. Society as a whole benefits when individuals are given a chance to prove themselves rather than being judged solely by their pasts.In conclusion, my recent experience of being denied a job due to my background check serves as a reminder of the critical need for a more equitable and understanding hiring process. Organizations should consider implementing policies that focus on the present capabilities and character of applicants rather than their past mistakes. By doing so, they can foster a more inclusive workplace that allows for second chances and encourages personal growth. My journey of rehabilitation is far from over, and I hope that future employers will look beyond my past and see the potential for a dedicated and reliable employee.","Sep 23, 2024",US

After waiting all day for it yesterday, they said to expect it today again, but again, they wouldn't give an estimated delivery time. Earlier today the app indicated that it was ""out for delivery"" locally, so my wife and I took turns staying home waiting to sign for it. Around 5:30 p.m. the app backtracked from ""out for delivery"" and said it was ""on the way"" from the Fort Worth hub about 230 miles from here. Guess what? It never arrived, and this is not my first such experience with FedEx. I had already made plans for tomorrow based on receiving it today.

1,They didn't try to deliver.,"The package was supposed to arrive on a Thursday. Then the day was suddenly changed to the Wednesday, the day before. I heard the truck pull up outside my place, and I waited (literally) right by the front door. The driver did not knock. Not only did they not knock, they were as quiet as a mouse putting a door tag on saying that the shipment was held for outstanding duties. I had already paid the duties that very same morning. No instructions were left on the door tag, the only thing written was the address of the distribution centre was scribbled out and a different one was penned in. The printed and scribbled out address was under 1km from my house, and the penned in one was 10km away. I called FedEx customer service to ask what this meant and what I was to do next, and they told me that if I wanted to I could pick up the package that same day after the time specified on my door tag. The delivery person had not specified a time on my door tag, they left that field blank. The CS rep said that delivery would be reattempted the next day.At this point, the tracking showed that the package was sitting at the distribution centre at 50 Barnes Road, Cambridge, Ontario, Canada. This status would not change.The following day, there was no delivery - not even a pretended attempt at a delivery like before, they just didn't even bother trying. I assumed that the CS rep had just been wrong, so I resigned myself to going in the next day to pick it up. The next day (now, the Friday), the status showed the package as still being at that distribution centre in Cambridge. So, I drove there and waited some time in line. When I was finally 'helped' by the gentleman behind the desk, he told me that the package wasn't there because it was on a truck to be delivered that day. Sure enough, when I got home there was an email I would have received approximately when I had first arrive at the FedEx centre, saying it was out for delivery - but they only told me that at 11.19am. This was unfortunate for me, as I was going to be working 8 hours that day and didn't want the package to be stolen.I needn't have worried about the package being stolen that night, however, as they 'reattempted' a delivery, but withheld the package AGAIN for 'outstanding duties and taxes' which, to be clear, I had paid the morning of the Wednesday, before the first delivery 'attempt' - over 48 hours ago by that point. I had a few quiet minutes at work, so after learning of this issue (which they didn't inform me of, I had to read the tracker to find that out) so I called customer service again. They told me that they couldn't reattempt delivery until Monday, and I asked if I could pick it up myself the following day, the Saturday. The CS rep told me the centre hours for Saturdays, and I asked him to promise me that if I went the next day, my package would be there. He told me that he would put me on a brief hold while he reached out to the rep at the Cambridge distribution centre, but when he got back he told me that no one was answering at that location - this was before it's closing hours too. He said he would write them a note and give them my contact info, and that they will call me the next day to confirm that my package is ready for pickup. I intend on arriving at the centre for as soon as they open tomorrow. I hope for the best and prepare for the worst, and will update after.","Sep 21, 2024",CA

It seems to me, they should know where the address is and charge accordingly.  So their great price that I try to pass on to my customers gets changed and cuts into my profit.  They have done this several times and have reimbursed me, but for some reason, not this last time, so I am no longer using them.

When an hour had passed the deadline, I called the FedEx 800 number. I could not speak to anyone. The automated system told me my package would arrive before 8 P.M. This was not the schedule in the email sent to me by FedEx. Then I tried to reach the local FedEx office. Again, there was no way to speak to a human. Simply the automated system repeating what I had already heard, and hanging up on me.I filed a report with FedEx through their chat feature. I have not heard from them.I spoke to FedEx employees who have confirmed this happens on a regular basis, that they had heard it from other customers. This indicates FedEx has taken no steps in fixing the problem. This is irresponsible behavior by a global company. DON’T PROMISE SOMETHING YOU CAN’T DELIVER.

It would have been nice to reach a human who might at least say, “You know, this happens sometimes, we’re very sorry and we’re working to fix the problem.” I would have been ok with this.

1,So...where to begin.,"So...where to begin.I ordered a very expensive camera lens, (around $2300 USD), and kept a very close eye on my tracking info once it got down to the wire. I had set it up to be shipped at a Walgreens near my place. I noticed that it said it had been delivered and decided to call Walgreens to confirm it was there before I drove there to claim it. I call, and to my horror they say it isn't there.""Huh, that's funny.."", I thought. Then I looked at the tracking closely and realized it didn't say WHERE it was delivered, just state and city, no address. That seemed very weird to me, so I called a close neighbor to go get the package off my porch, to which she reported promptly that the parcel was nowhere to be seen. To make matters much worse, I saw that it was signed over to someone who did NOT have my last name. It was at this point I knew someone had messed up royally.This is where I began a missing package claim. I got ahold of someone who did not speak very clear English at all, and I got mad at her, demanding to speak to her manager, who also didn't speak very well, though clearer than the other. I got to the point I was very frustrated, but she did tell me she'd get on the case. I didn't feel too confident at this point, but decided I needed to just wait it out and see what happens. Well, thankfully a man from the local station called some hours later and told me the exact location they sent it to. The location address was so dissimilar to mine that I still don't understand HOW they could have taken it there. I decided to go to that address and ask for my parcel back myself because I did not trust them at all. I get there, thinking it would be a residential address like mine, but it wasn't. It was an auto body shop, a CAR SHOP guys. They told me they had the package and promptly handed it to me, knowing that it didn't make any sense as there was no one there with my name, and they hadn't placed an order that would fit the small dimensions of the box. Thank GOD I got my lens in my possession, but guys, this is unacceptable. I could lost $2300 over that very poor delivery. I have never had this kind of issue with UPS.I am FED up with FedEx.

Called customer support again gave them the confirmation number and was then confirmed again it was not being delivered 30 days early but on the original delivery date. And of course customer support is useless and it was delivered 30 days early. Our package is now missing and the owners of the new home deny taking it.

Yesterday i told them to hold my package at fedex office so that i can pickup from there but today when u went there they said we have nothing for you.

1,TERRIBLE COMPANY,"Besides being smexually harassed by a driver when I was walking my dog, they continually deliver my items to the incorrect unit number causing many of my items to be stolen. This has caused so much anxiety in my life. I suffer from ptsd and anxiety and heavily rely on delivery services. Having to constantly search for my packages, call my apartment community, call FedEx, ask neighbors for my items back, reorder things. This is ridiculous. FedEx never called back about me being smexually harassed. They have not fixed the issue of my items being delivered incorrectly. They have not made a note to deliver to my door since they are incapable of using parcel pending correctly. I’m tired of their terrible service and I hope they go out of business.","Sep 18, 2024",US

Same with the word TOMORROW which could mean some nebulous day into the future.  But to be clear, it NEVER means today or tomorrow as we understand in the English language.  If you want more accurate predictions of when you may receive your package, you can contact a physicist who may be able to calculate arrival times as per Mars schedule.  A naïve customer might adjust the time on the FedEx tracker to his time where he is located; that would make no difference whatsoever as that time adjustment was only put there so FedEx could track how stupid their customers are.

Their driver actually walked up to my door and left the door tag rather than just leave the packages that did not require his signature or a person to be present for delivery.  This will be raw meat rotting in their warehouse that I will be expected to dispose of in two days. I was assured on two separate calls today that it would be delivered by end of business and told to call back at 8 pm if not received. When calling back at 8:00, because of course it wasn’t delivered, I’m told no supervisors are available to speak to and that I have no choice but to wait until Monday to receive my rotted delivery.

When I called, Fedex refused to help me because I did not have the delivery address. They acknowledged that they had it but would not help. A supervisor was supposed to call me back. That never happened. They wre totally useless. So be aware, if you drop off a package, even though you have a drop off confirmation; they won't help you unless you have the address you shipped it to. Because it was a return, I was unable to re-print the return labels. The authorized shipping centre does not keep the addresses on file.","Sep 12, 2024",CA

I was told by the company I purchased from and even got a confirmation text from fedex that it was to be expected on that stated date. My problem is not the lateness of the package, it is the customer service following. After waiting all day with no update, I check the status and it still says “delivering on time” welp, that’s just entirely not true. After calling fedex to ask why they are not being accountable for the delay they told me that because it is still within the handful of days they originally stated, so that means it’s still “on time”. Insane business practice. Not to mention I called to leave a review and the woman on the phone hung up on me when I was waiting to be transferred to the survey. Never ever using FedEx again. Wow.","Sep 12, 2024",US

1,Fedex complete mishandling of misdelivery,"I’m had a misdeliveries occur. My package was delivered to the wrong address, even though the correct address was on the label. Usually, you contact FedEx customer service and they contact the station to contact the driver. If they can retrieve it, you get your package same day if not next day. This is one FedExs website as their procedure for handling misdelivered packages. I called customer support 2 hours after the misdelivery. The customer service rep from the call center did not follow procedure. She never contacted the station for the misdelivery. I had called back several times wondering why I hadn’t received my package. Every single rep lied to me. I spoke to 5 reps and finally a week later I found out that there never was an investigation sent to the station. The reps just didn’t do their jobs. The blatant lying from FedEx customer service reps was beyond worrisome for any form of customer service. I would recommend if you can to contact your local station and contact them directly. The 1-800 number is beyond useless and they will not take care of your problems.","Sep 12, 2024",US

In the past I would take time off from work to be there for the signature etc and no shipment arrived. This must have been the 4-5th time FedEx has been fooling me.

Refuses to deliver there because....I don't know why??? Get the run around whenever I call.

1,Will never use FedEx ever again,"If I could give zero Stars I would. I waited all day for my delivery which required a signature I had to take the day off of work so I lost a whole day's pay and I got a point because I had to take the day off and with my company you get so many points and you get fired. But because this delivery was important and it required a signature I had to do it. The delivery driver stated he attempted delivery which was a total lie. I have been home all day nobody attempted any delivery. When I called customer service they claimed they couldn't make it to my house because the road was bad. We have no standing water anywhere on any roads, the weather is sunny and 72°, there's no obstacles in any of the roads, so there was absolutely no reason the driver couldn't make it. As I was on the phone with customer service Amazon pulled in my driveway and delivered me a package which I stated it's amazing how Amazon is at my house right now delivering a package but FedEx couldn't make it here. She said because of the time they couldn't try to redeliver the package today that they could attempt it another day I told her I cannot attempt it another day I had to take a day off of work this was the day it was supposed to be delivered this was the day I took the day off this was the day that I lost a whole day's pay and got a point for my job so no I cannot do it another day. If I ever order another package and it states it's going to be shipped through FedEx I will cancel my order if they do not ship with another carrier. I will never personally go to FedEx to ship a package I would use the post office before I used FedEx and that's saying a lot if anybody has ever had experiences with post office delivery.","Sep 12, 2024",US

I went online and got three numbers to call which all of the staff gave me a 0900 number to call not one of there staff helped me or wanted too , the 0900 number cost between £3.60 to £6 per MINUTE to call I’m a full time carer only getting paid £86 per week I can’t afford to pay those charges .

1,If I could NOT give a star I would,"If I could NOT give a star I would. Every 6 months for the past 3,5 years I’ve been contacting FedX at least 2 days in advance to schedule a pick up.

I scheduled it for pick up in 9/9/24 by 10:30am no later than 1pm. They NEVER showed up even though I called them FOUR times to ask why and each time they kept moving the pick up time. Since the medical sample would spoil if NOT picked up on time and delivered in 3 days, I looked around my home for a local FexX drop off location (I am an elderly lady who avoids driving around as much as I can). I dropped the package off returned home. UNBELIEVABLY but FedX showed up at my home THE NEXT DAY at around 2:30-3pm on 9/10/24 to pick up the package. I called FedX and asked to talk to a supervisor after waiting on line I was told she or he didn’t want to talk to me. WHO CAN WE TRUST IN THIS COUNTRY ANYMORE? This country is broke beyond repair. DO NOT TRUST FEDX ANYMORE and I don’t if I can convince the lab to use another delivery method and if ANY delivery/carrier is any better. WE ARE DOOMED!

I thought it was just the drivers around my area, but after seeing literally every other review on here it’s across the entire nation if not around the globe. To say that’s just a coincidence is absolutely foolish and impossible. They train the drivers to do the absolute worst job possible. How are they still in business? Why are they still in business? PEOPLE NEED TO STOP USING THIS SO CALLED “COMPANY” THAT’S RAN BY A BUNCH OF LESSER THAN SUBHUMANS WITH NO ETHICS AND CONSIDERATIONS WHO ALSO EMPLOYS A BUNCH OF SUBHUMANS WITH NO ETHICS AND CONSIDERATIONS. 95% of their “drivers” do not even know how to operate a vehicle (of any class) and who ever issued these disgraces a license in the first place should be fired and their own licenses revoked. I like to find at least one positive quality to begin with when faced to leave the unfortunate negative reveiw, but FedEx makes sure that’s not even a possibility. That being said, I will at least leave a tip to any FedEx “drivers” as well as the ones who’s in charge of hiring such “drivers”.
