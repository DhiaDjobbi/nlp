1,Driver didn't even bother,"Driver didn't even bother trying to deliver the parcel. I was home, we also have an entrance way and stairwell where it would have been safe to leave the parcel, as well as a mailbox out the front of the property. Clearly the driver just took it straight to a drop off point instead of trying to deliver it at all. Customer service was pretty useless too, just told me to leave delivery instructions to help the driver. From now on I'll have to add ""knock on the door"" as their staff seem incapable of doing the most basic tasks without explicit instructions",12 hours ago,driver even bother trying deliver parcel home also entrance way stairwell would safe leave parcel well mailbox front property clearly driver took straight drop point instead trying deliver customer service pretty useless told leave delivery instruction help driver add knock door staff seem incapable basic task without explicit instruction
1,I took a big loss using Sendle,"Tried using Sendle during the Canada Post strike to send Christmas parcel (book) to friends and paints to customers. I run a small paint store.Five parcels made it over a period of a month. Given it was Christmas season and given Canada Post was on strike I wasn't too upset with one month delivery time as the volume they had to deal with was enormous.The other five parcels completely vanished. No live human to talk to and no one from Sendle is reaching out to us even though we reported the losses over two weeks ago.The Christmas book loss sucks but not too bad, $25 book that I can repurchase and resend with Canada Post. One of the paint order losses was over $300, not to mention a customer who will likely never use our store again.If Canada Post goes on strike again, I will just close down and go fishing before I trust Sendle with any of my parcels again.",2 days ago,tried using sendle canada post strike send christmas parcel book friend paint customer run small paint parcel made period month given christmas season given canada post strike upset one month delivery time volume deal five parcel completely vanished live human talk one sendle reaching u even though reported loss two week christmas book loss suck bad 25 book repurchase resend canada post one paint order loss 300 mention customer likely never use store canada post go strike close go fishing trust sendle parcel

1,The worst shipping experience ever,"The worst shipping experience ever. The subcontror delivery driver didn't even attempt to make the drop off. He must have not seen my number,  showed down on the road without pulling into driveway, then honked(!) once, and sped off without giving me a chance to get to my door. I was baffled.

Rates are also more affordable than Canada Post, which is nice.

1,Even if Sendle was free - don't do it,"Even if Sendle was free, it's not worth the stress of its terrible service. They also seem to seek out the worst Courier partners, wherever they operate in the world, just read the other reviews. Generally they seem to partner with Couriers who just never pick up parcels from hubs, lose or destroy the parcels they do pick up, or have sub-human social skills when interacting with any other humans along the way. Customer Service agents are also not armed with much information or recourse to help customers because Sendle clearly has very few remediation processes or options for Customers that they are willing to undertake, meaning Service Agents bear the brunt of Customer frustration from all over the world. Can't imagine how thin their service playbook would be.Some super weird questions/quotes from them in providing 'solutions' to complaints/queries include:[Destroyed parcel] ""Do you have a picture of what the parcel originally looked like before this happened?""[Courier yelled at receptionist] ""Sorry about that. Is there anything else I can help you with today?""[parcel not picked up from hub in over 4 weeks] ""Have you tried getting it back and using someone else?""Truly chaotic.They position themselves as providing a cost-effective alternative to well established postal and courier services...but instead just illustrate that a 5% saving for rock bottom reliability and service is just not worth the hours of you'll lose out of your life.","Jan 22, 2025",even sendle free worth stress terrible service also seem seek worst courier partner wherever operate world read review generally seem partner courier never pick parcel hub lose destroy parcel pick social skill interacting human along way customer service agent also armed much information recourse help customer sendle clearly remediation process option customer willing undertake meaning service agent bear brunt customer frustration world ca imagine thin service playbook would super weird providing include destroyed parcel picture parcel originally looked like happened courier yelled receptionist sorry anything else help today parcel picked hub 4 week tried getting back using someone else truly position providing alternative well established postal courier service instead illustrate 5 saving rock bottom reliability service worth hour lose life

1,Package Not Picked Up for Over a Month,I sent a parcel over a month ago and it has STILL NOT BEEN PICKED UP! I dropped it off at one of their drop off locations. It was also recommended that you drop it off rather than get them to pick it from you directly due to the high volume of packages in Canada. I have reached out to support many times and they refuse to tell me when it will be picked up. They also recommended I go and get the parcel and ship it with someone else. Your whole business is to ship things...and you can't even do that.

1,Avoid Sendle - not worth the hassle,"I launched an e-commerce business in Dec 2024 and used Sendle for some of my shipments. They lost 40 packages and it was overall a terrible experience. They contract with local delivery drivers on both ends of the delivery. There is a lot of opportunity for mistakes since it seems like the delivery people aren't invested at all in doing their job. Packages were picked up but never scanned properly so it looks like packages weren't picked up. Sendle will launch an investigation and then tell you they have no proof it was picked up and will not refund the shipping or allow you to file a product claim. For packages that get lost somewhere along the way, they will also try to investigate but make it difficult for you to file a claim. So I guess I'll just have to take the hit for a couple thousand dollars of shipping fees, lost product, and resending product so my customers actually get what they ordered. I'm very surprised that Sendle is still in business. Lesson learned, stick with the established carriers like UPS and FedEx with actual employees that care about doing a good job.","Jan 13, 2025",launched business dec 2024 used sendle shipment lost 40 package overall terrible experience contract local delivery driver end delivery lot opportunity mistake since seems like delivery people invested job package picked never scanned properly look like package picked sendle launch investigation tell proof picked refund shipping allow file product claim package get lost somewhere along way also try investigate make difficult file claim guess take hit couple thousand dollar shipping fee lost product resending product customer actually get ordered surprised sendle still business lesson learned stick established carrier like ups fedex actual employee care good job

Their pick-up window of 8am to 6pm is also ridiculous as some businesses operate between 9am to 5pm. Upon speaking to the second customer service agent they said someone would show up at 6pm that day that I scheduled the pick-up so I arranged for someone to stay late in the office and guess what? They didn't show up. What a waste of time and resources. Also, their 'Pick-up Guarantee' is an absolute joke: ""If for some reason we still do not attempt the pickup the business day after the scheduled day, we will refund the cost of the delivery. We will still attempt to pickup and deliver the parcel."" I received no apologies or refunds. Originally scheduled Dec 10 then 13 then FINALLY picked up on 16.

1,During the Canada Post strike we used Sendle ...,"While it was helpful to have a delivery method during the postal problems, there are significant issues and flaws with the service that make it very not useable for retail and business purposes where transparent tracking and timely delivery are necessary. The Number 1 problem with Sendle and ICS Courier is, as stated above, the lack of transparent tracking. A parcel can have - and usually does have - multiple carriers when sending via ICS | Sendle, including an initial freight handler that deals with ALL parcels dispatched. A customer and seller will both receive a ""delivered"" notification when only the freight handler or one of multiple carriers involved receives the parcel yet, the item is not ""delivered"" to the customer and they are confused. You have to message into Sendle directly each time to get all the latest tracking numbers and then communicate these constantly to your buyer. The Number 2 problem relates to claims and insured coverage. When a parcel is lost in transit, Sendle does not easily refund you the shipping or insured value. In our case, they wanted an Affadavit of loss even though they had the buyer email, the buyer's confirmation of non-receipt of goods and the online invoice showing sale value. I will never use them again.","Updated Jan 19, 2025",helpful delivery method postal problem significant issue flaw service make useable retail business purpose transparent tracking timely delivery necessary number 1 problem sendle ic courier stated lack transparent tracking parcel usually multiple carrier sending via ic sendle including initial freight handler deal parcel dispatched customer seller receive delivered notification freight handler one multiple carrier involved receives parcel yet item delivered customer confused message sendle directly time get latest tracking number communicate constantly buyer number 2 problem relates claim insured coverage parcel lost transit sendle easily refund shipping insured value case wanted affadavit loss even though buyer email buyer confirmation good online invoice showing sale value never use

In many cases parcels have just been stolen or disappeared. There is an easily accessible pedestrian gate for the courier to deliver parcels to the correct unit number however this would require actually doing his job and putting in a bit of effort to walk a bit further, so obviously it's just easier to jump out of the van and dump it in the rubbish bin enclosure than actually deliver it to the correct townhouse door. Lazy, incompetent and unprofessional. A few residents have lodged complaints but nothing changes and I was actually told the drivers endeavour to leave parcels in a safe place!  On what planet is an outside rubbish bin enclosure a safe place when it should be delivered to the actual unit number addressed clearly on the parcels. It is pure laziness and lack of care.

1,Absolutely disgusting service.,"Absolutely disgusting service.Bought an item from Dandenong Victoria, the company sent it via Sendle to my address which was only 3 hours away. I was given a tracking number. I watched the item sit at the courier depot for a week, then allegedly sent.

I call the company I bought the item from to let them know not to use Sendle and I get a crappy response from them about manpower, Black Friday and Xmas. I bought the item a week or more before Black Friday.Then I complain via their email, I feel all I get are bots talking back to me.

So, despite all their promises of escalating and doing all they can to rectify the problem they did nothing of the sort for a whole week. 5 times they told me this.

It was delivered today by COURIERS PLEASE for SENDLE As usual the driver threw the package containing $87 of product in a glass bottle from my gate onto my tiled porch. I saw him do it and called out to stop, but he fled. I then lodged my third driver complaint this year, for the same behaviour with COURIERS PLEASE. There is never any outcome, just excuses and usually a demand for my camera footage.I was then sent an email from SENDLE asking me to rate them. I did this and tried to submit it and their site refused it indicating I had not filled out 1 box with drop down options. No matter what option I chose it wouldn't accept any, so I couldn't submit my feedback. I then tried the online chat which also blocked any requests for help or a contact option. I have camera footage, photos and screenshots of today's dual company substandard service and damage.

One package did not leave Australia and was sent back- no explanation has been provided, despite this being ""escalated""!3. Sendle LACKS ANY VISBILITY with international suppliers and is NOT WILLING to follow through with those suppliers to get detailed responses - Sendle does NOT take ANY ownership whatsoever once packages have left their hands and given to LOCAL OR INTERNATIONAL DELIVERY SUPPLIERS.4. Sendle has offered NO EXPLANATION why their Sendle POLICIES were NOT FOLLOWED prior to the 6 packages all leaving Sendle's hands - ie weighing and checking sizes of packages and charging extra if required (if that was the issue- STILL UNKNOWN)?5. Sendle states that I should be tracking the international leg of my packages trip via local delivery supplier - however when the tracking numbers were supplied there was NO INFORMATION supplied ie NO VISIBILITY! 6. Sendle stated they were following it up when the lack of tracking information was pointed out - BUT THAT was OBVIOUSLY A LIE.7. Sendle then eventually supplied 2 different delivery carriers for each package (each with different tracking numbers!!!) and told me to contact them for information on where my packages were!8.

Most recently I sent a package from Brisbane to Darwin, it was not collected for four days due to Sendle failed systems and 28 days later the item still remains undelivered and Sendle has no idea where it is. Bypass Sendle and deal directly with the transport company when booking, Sendle is the worst business in Australia. After 33 days and Sendle state they have lost my parcel. It is important to remember that the reputation of good courier businesses like Couriers Please, who are very efficient, prompt, and courteous, are being tarnished by the incompetence of Sendle - Sendle are only a 'booking service' for couriers, they take the cream off the top and it is the courier companies that do all the work, whereas Sendle - employees all based overseas - steal money from Australian's and then take 33-days to tell you that they have lost your parcel.

On four separate occasions I asked for the matter to be escalated and to speak to a supervisor but no-one was willing to speak to me. The supplier of the goods stepped in to try to resolve the farcical situation and organised a new delivery with AusPost which arrived today without incident. Sendle have still not answered my query or contacted me in any way. I was told I would receive an email which has never arrived. Instead, my online query just now says ‘case closed’.

1,The worst delivery company in Australia?,"My heart sinks every time I see a company I have purchased from uses Sendle...and once again I am experiencing the nightmare that is a Sendle delivery. Firstly, the delivery lead times are ridiculous. 7 days to get a parcel from Katoomba to the Sydney CBD? I could walk up and back 3 times in 7 days. Secondly, their website tracking is useless. The only parcel tracking I had access to was ""estimated delivery between the 2nd December and the 7th December"". What?? How is that meant to be helpful. Thirdly, no status change or updates at all during that delivery window...and no further communication on the progress of my delivery. Finally, once again, even with 7 days to get a parcel from Katoomba to Sydney CBD that was beyond Sendle and so 7 days later I am still waiting for my parcel....and have just been told that their internal review of my missing parcel report will take 5 days. What??? Sendle is a complete and utter joke. Their website and logistics tracking feels like it is from the 1990s and their customer service is completely non-existent. If you are a business, please don't use them to send your products to your customers as it is a nightmare for us and will only damage your brand.","Dec 7, 2022",heart sink every time see company purchased us sendle experiencing nightmare sendle delivery firstly delivery lead time ridiculous 7 day get parcel katoomba sydney cbd could walk back 3 time 7 day secondly website tracking useless parcel tracking access estimated delivery 2nd december 7th december meant helpful thirdly status change update delivery window communication progress delivery finally even 7 day get parcel katoomba sydney cbd beyond sendle 7 day later still waiting parcel told internal review missing parcel report take 5 day sendle complete utter joke website logistics tracking feel like 1990s customer service completely business please use send product customer nightmare u damage brand

1,Worst courier service,"Made a sale on eBay and chose Sendle's ""Printer-Free Parcel Pickup"". Followed all the instructions, writing the tracking code and address on the parcel as required. The day my parcel was schedule to be picked up, I waited at home all day. The courier never showed up. Instead they recorded an ""attempt"" and stated that the parcel wasn't ready to be collected. A complete lie. I contacted both eBay and Sendle via ""live chat"", and after 8hrs they finally responded and said they would reschedule the pickup for the following day. The courier actually came the following day, but refused to take my parcel, saying that I must print the label. I explained I had purchased the label-free pickup, but the courier would not listen. They told me that a label-free service didn't exist and that Sendle was wrong, and then they just left. I contacted Sendle again, and after another significant delay they rescheduled pickup again for the next day, this time guaranteeing that the courier would not reject the parcel again and that they would be explicitly informed that I do not need to have a printed label on the parcel. The next day the courier comes and rejects the parcel again. More explaining from me, more rejection from the courier and they just leave without my parcel. I contact Sendle again and they just reschedule...Three days wasted and my customer is no closer to receiving their order.This is an absolute deflection of any responsibility, with no care or consideration for customers. Really unacceptable for any service industry. And I would add that eBay was equally useless in assisting in the matter, absolving themselves of any responsibility for facilitating the Sendle ""service"" and just deflecting the onus back onto Sendle, all the while taking a commission of the sale.I'll also note that eBay does subtly disclose caveats to the printer-free pickup service (you really have to look hard for them). This service is only available in certain suburbs, and my suburb was included in the service area. Moving forward, I would avoid Sendle at all costs, and after almost 12 years selling on eBay, I will be taking my business elsewhere.","Dec 2, 2022",made sale ebay chose sendle parcel pickup followed instruction writing tracking code address parcel required day parcel schedule picked waited home day courier never showed instead recorded attempt stated parcel ready collected complete lie contacted ebay sendle via live chat 8hrs finally responded said would reschedule pickup following day courier actually came following day refused take parcel saying must print label explained purchased pickup courier would listen told service exist sendle wrong left contacted sendle another significant delay rescheduled pickup next day time guaranteeing courier would reject parcel would explicitly informed need printed label parcel next day courier come reject parcel explaining rejection courier leave without parcel contact sendle reschedule three day wasted customer closer receiving absolute deflection responsibility care consideration customer really unacceptable service industry would add ebay equally useless assisting matter absolving responsibility facilitating sendle service deflecting onus back onto sendle taking commission also note ebay subtly disclose caveat pickup service really look hard service available certain suburb suburb included service area moving forward would avoid sendle cost almost 12 year selling ebay taking business elsewhere
2,Sendle - We're Good at Dropping the Ball,"Sendle have taken the approach to approve ATL (no signature deliveries) where the Sender requires a signature to ensure the item can be verified as 'delivered' as a part of their Covid Management policy (it's nearly 2023 guys - this is not an excuse anymore). As a result, I have seen an increase in the number of packages that are treated like a drop and run where the Addressee is claiming they have not got the item. This is not good for a business sending things out, particularly when the company responsible for the delivery washes their hands off any responsibility.Lately, there has also been an increase in items marked as RTS which are getting 'lost' and Sendle has gone silent on any matters relating to these. Don't expect much more than an auto responder to your message sent through their 'support' portal.Another issue they have not acted on for over 3 years since I first raised the matter with them is that there is no ticketing system that provides the Customer with any visibility on how a support request is being managed. Pro tip: Use HubSpot or some other CRM to keep a log of these yourself. Sendle have failed to ensure transparency here, which is a shame.To date, I have sent over 840 items with Sendle. In the earlier days they left others for dead. Now, they are getting more expensive than AusPost, and their service is appalling.","Dec 2, 2022",sendle taken approach approve atl signature delivery sender requires signature ensure item verified part covid management policy nearly 2023 guy excuse anymore result seen increase number package treated like drop run addressee claiming got item good business sending thing particularly company responsible delivery wash hand also increase item marked rts getting sendle gone silent matter relating expect much auto responder message sent issue acted 3 year since first raised matter ticketing system provides customer visibility support request managed pro tip use hubspot crm keep log sendle failed ensure transparency date sent 840 item sendle earlier day left others dead getting expensive auspost service appalling

1,The worst company - DO NOT USE SENDLE,Sender and receiver:Sent my toolbox sized parcel October 14th 2022 (Shouldn't be easily misplaced!)I did this as a test run as we were going to use Sendle when we moved states.Found out after 2 weeks that it was unable to be delivered with no explanation given why.Tried to update the delivery instructions but then after a month the website said was being returned.All this was found by checking the website. Sendle did not send any notifications of proceedings themselves.More time passed then I found that the parcel was unable to be located and they were carrying out an internal investigation. After this was completed they confirmed they had lost the parcel and tried to deny compensation claiming the courier had returned it to my address of sending which was false. They were unable to provide any evidence of this either.Its now 6 weeks since I sent the parcel and during this process I tried multiple times for a phone or email response. The email response takes days if you're lucky and the chat support is a bot and pretty much useless until you persist long enough to get through to what appears to be an overseas chat service.Sendle is the worst company I have ever had to deal with.

Stay away, the cheap rates are just not worth it","I sent a parcel (vintage corningware), their driver ran over it and it arrived to the buyer in pieces! Buyer sent me the photos (tyre marks over box, corningware smashed in pieces despite double bubble wrap and stuffing in box) I forwarded the pictures to them. The parcel had $100 insurance which was the cost of the item so I claimed it from them and they said I should have a refund within a couple of weeks. I got the refund to the postage costs (roughly$15) back to my credit card in 2 days. The $100 refund however has not happened, despite numerous assurances that it will be in my bank account 'this week'....3 months+ later still no refund! They initially sent me 'proof' of refund deposit which was not much more than a piece of paper with my name on it (!!??) and they kept asking for me to check with my bank and it's not their issue???! After at least 8 emails they agreed to check on their deposit, it turns out they lost my bank details and the initial 'deposit' ""came back to them as the account details must have been wrong"". So I sent the details again (why can't they get it from my account sign up?). 2 months since the resending of details, still no refund. Only a weekly email from an overseas polite and apologetic girl who clearly has no control over their ABSOLUTELY INCOMPETENT accounts department. They clearly have no intention of refunding anything I think, so they've employed someone to send continuous apologies. It will cost them way more than $100 in loss of business and reputation, mucking around over $100. Disgusting! I'm refunding my buyer as I feel bad for them but this should not be a cost for me to wear. How are these clowns allowed to do business like this? ebay has made money from the sale, I've lost nice corningware and some poor soul is $100 out of pocket. Lets not mention the cost of the 3 month frustration having to deal with crooks.Additionally their sendle application dashboard is quite substandard.

1,Terrible service,"Terrible service. Parcel not picked up and no option to escalate as the customer. Sendle don’t provide a phone number, email or online chat. Eventually escalated to sender after 2 weeks and they were able to organize for parcel to be picked up. Picked up 20/5. Now parcel has gone missing somewhere between Melbourne and Perth. Sendle do provide an option to initiate an investigation which they are now doing but will take 5 business days. Updates require going to the sendle website. No information about where the parcel is currently - is it in Melbourne still? Has it arrived in Perth? Is it somewhere else? The communication is poor, the lack of options to speak with someone is disgraceful. The tracking updates have been useless “parcel processing at depot” listed on 26/4 and 4/5 - really? Which city is that depot in? Would much rather pay a little bit more and use a company that I can communicate with for peace of mind when things go wrong. From reading other reviews it seems that parcels do go missing not infrequently and claiming the refund via the insurance that sendle provide is an extremely difficult process. Expecting I will need to escalate to consumer affairs to get a resolution which is unsatisfactory.","May 10, 2022",terrible service parcel picked option escalate customer sendle provide phone number email online chat eventually escalated sender 2 week able organize parcel picked picked parcel gone missing somewhere melbourne perth sendle provide option initiate investigation take 5 business day update require going sendle website information parcel currently melbourne still arrived perth somewhere else communication poor lack option speak someone disgraceful tracking update useless parcel processing depot listed really city depot would much rather pay little bit use company communicate peace mind thing go wrong reading review seems parcel go missing infrequently claiming refund via insurance sendle provide extremely difficult process expecting need escalate consumer affair get resolution unsatisfactory

I ran (literally) down to the delivery hub to see what the status was and it was no longer there - some courier had picked it up.By the 23rd, when tracking still indicated 'at the hub' I re-escalted and they opened an investigation. I checked daily and was told by March 2nd they'd have a resolution. On March 2nd when I chased, they said they just started an investigation and updated the tracking. Part of that was to email the customer asking if they got it, and also re-re-asking the Hub if it was there. Literally the first steps that should be occurring. Oddly they asked me the race, gender, appearance of the courier that picked it up...They were clearly grasping at leads.The disappointing thing is, since the customer was already annoyed, or the Sendle email went to spam, and did not respond Sendle assumes it was received and does not pay out the insurance claim.","Mar 1, 2022",used sendle via ebay send package dropped 10th expected day delivery 17th customer annoyed delay escalated sendle said would picked day ran literally delivery hub see status longer courier picked 23rd tracking still indicated hub opened investigation checked daily told march 2nd resolution march 2nd chased said started investigation updated tracking part email customer asking got also hub literally first step occurring oddly asked race gender appearance courier picked clearly grasping disappointing thing since customer already annoyed sendle email went spam respond sendle assumes received pay insurance claim

1,Where do I start?,"Well, where do I start? I live in the UK and my family live in Australia, and as usual I ordered lots of different gifts for them at Christmas time.  On the 26th November 2021, I ordered a sportswear top for my son as his Christmas gift, and hadn’t received notification about it being delivered.  On the 19th December I enquired with Sendle if it had been delivered and then discovered that I’d made an error with the address, so informed Sendle of my mistake which they acknowledged and changed the delivery address.  There was no house at all at the number I had mistakenly put on the order. On the 31st December I had an email confirming that the gift had been delivered, immediately contacted my son who checked and it hadn’t been delivered so I set up an investigation with Sendle.  The “missing” parcel was found! Yaayy!! On the 9th and 10th January, the couriers attempted delivery at the property where there was no house! So I contacted Sendle again through the live chat and whilst on the chat, a very helpful customer happiness team member named Lucille, sent an email to their couriers telling them of the correct address.  On the 11th January the tracking page was updated and nothing happened at all. I informed Lucille that my son was moving house on Friday 14th Jan so it would have to delivered before then.  Today, they have delivered his Christmas gift, you guessed it right, to the address where there isn’t a house, so they left it at a completely different address on the same street! It is with absolute luck that the lady who took the delivery, phoned my son and he has now been and collected the parcel.  The thing I find most odd is that my sons phone number was on the parcel but at no time, in the 4 times that Sendle’s third party couriers were trying to deliver to a none existent property, have they picked up the phone and asked what the correct address was!! There are some serious practices that need reviewing and updating with Sendle and their partner couriers.  Totally unacceptable and terrible parcel delivery service! Avoid!","Jan 17, 2022",well start live uk family live australia usual ordered lot different gift christmas time 26th november 2021 ordered sportswear top son christmas gift received notification delivered 19th december enquired sendle delivered discovered made error address informed sendle mistake acknowledged changed delivery address house number mistakenly put order 31st december email confirming gift delivered immediately contacted son checked delivered set investigation sendle missing parcel found yaayy 9th 10th january courier attempted delivery property house contacted sendle live chat whilst chat helpful customer happiness team member named lucille sent email courier telling correct address 11th january tracking page updated nothing happened informed lucille son moving house friday 14th jan would delivered today delivered christmas gift guessed right address house left completely different address street absolute luck lady took delivery phoned son collected parcel thing find odd son phone number parcel time 4 time sendle third party courier trying deliver none existent property picked phone asked correct address serious practice need reviewing updating sendle partner courier totally unacceptable terrible parcel delivery service avoid

Don’t use it!,"They like to dumb parcels outside secured buildings literally on a street because for some reason delivery person doesn’t contact concierge of the building to open the door neither actual receiver, and not even trying to call intercom (full address of the apartment number is provided).Sadly, another company I ordered stuff from uses Sendle so I kind of already knew what to expect and of course it meant to happen! Not a surprise anymore but of course with a cherry on top and my parcel is most likely stolen now…So Sendle sent me an email on the 9th of December saying that the parcel was delivered but I actually never received it at all and lodge a complain with them now - still waiting for a response.Also, one time they dumb another one of my parcels outside on a street near the door in front of the apartment building besides that we have a concierge who could open the door but also I was home for the whole day that day but the delivery person didn’t even try calling intercom, he/she just left my items outside on a street where random people could steal it, luckily my husband came home and picked it up from outside (that time I thought, okay things happen and it’s not stollen so I decided not to report it). BUT now it’s getting really annoying. Sendle is very irresponsible company, the delivery people just don’t care if anyone steals parcels. Well, this time I couldn’t sit quiet, everyone needs to know what this company does.I’m not sure why companies still use their mailing services as they have quite bad reviews on google and other review online platforms, and seems people have the same problem like I have now.

1,Lost my family's Xmas presents.,"I sent a box full of Christmas presents with Sendle in late October (got myself organised early for once given that postage is so delayed everywhere). Expected delivery time was 2-3 weeks (it's a regional destination and it's COVID times so whatever, that's just how it is.)It took 6 days after pickup from my doorstep for it even to appear as in transit with the tracking note ""Your parcel has arrived at the depot for delivery in the next available cycle"".That's unusual, not at all in line with the tracking I've had from every other parcel I've sent (including one two weeks earlier to the same destination). Those all updated after pickup with the message ""Transfer to xxxx"". This other update looks more like a note for when it reaches the destination depot, not the source. 10 hours later it gets another ""In transit"" update with no note. This is the last time any update appeared for this parcel.2 weeks later, the expected delivery window has completely passed and I launch a missing parcel enquiry. It takes 10 days for Sendle to perform their ""investigation process"" which I suspect is where they do mostly nothing while their website automatically moves a progress bar every day or 2 to give you the impression something is happening.At the end of the 10 day ""investigation"" the receiver is sent an email asking if they got the parcel, which obviously they did not. So Sendle notify me I'm getting a refund for the shipping (still yet to see the actual funds though). Thanks Sendle, very cool. Guess my family's not getting their presents this year. Based on the weird tracking, they're probably sitting under the pickup driver's tree.Safe to say I won't be using Sendle ever again.","Nov 26, 2021",sent box full christmas present sendle late october got organised early given postage delayed everywhere expected delivery time week regional destination covid time whatever took 6 day pickup doorstep even appear transit tracking note parcel arrived depot delivery next available cycle unusual line tracking every parcel sent including one two week earlier destination updated pickup message transfer xxxx update look like note reach destination depot source 10 hour later get another transit update note last time update appeared week later expected delivery window completely passed launch missing parcel enquiry take 10 day sendle perform investigation process suspect mostly nothing website automatically move progress bar every day 2 give impression something end 10 day investigation receiver sent email asking got parcel obviously sendle notify getting refund shipping still yet see actual fund though thanks sendle cool guess family getting present year based weird tracking probably sitting pickup driver say wo using sendle ever

As the sender I did not receive any advice that the delivery had not occurred. I only knew that package had not arrived after the receiver lodged a complaint. I requested a redelivery and it was only then that it was discovered that the package could not be located. Sendle did appear to conduct a thorough search, however, the package has not been located.

Our store was open, receptionist at the front of the store. Our front door is glass. We were clearly open, yet we got an email saying our parcels couldn't be picked up?

1,Just awful service,"I work and live in a large complex that has a reception that is attended during business hours. This means that deliveries can be made even when I am not there. This usually works well and even AusPost can get it right.I recently made an online purchase only to find that it had been given to Sendle / Couriers Please (I cant work out which does what) for delivery. I knew that I would be away for a week but naively thought that a courier would be able to work out how to deliver an item to a reception area. No such luck.Sendle/Couriers Please made one attempt to deliver the item apparently couldn't work out how to deliver it to reception and sent me a sms to tell me to collect the item from a depot ""within five days"" or else the item would be returned to sender. I am not nearby - I cant get to the depot in five days.Impossible to contact the courier - I get a ""we are very busy at the moment, but will try and get back to you"" type message.So now, the item will hopefully be returned to the sender. I will have to arrange with the sender to send the item back to me (using AusPost this time).This is not the first time that I have had a problem with this mob. Had I known that they were the preferred courier I would have either instructed the sender to use AusPost or I would not have made the online purchase.I would not recommend using Sendle/Couriers Please under any circumstances.More than a week of trying to contact Sendle and so far no response - its like there is nobody there - difficult to understand how to get assistance at all.

1,"SENDLE FRAUD, FAKE : NO ACTION ON LOST PARCEL","This is further to my previous review of Sendle. After at least 20 reminders to Sendle, they have not returned with any satisfactory answer. They said today that my two parcels SXR7HTN & SFPQ3JX were delivered and they sent me two fake pictures of doors they said the parcels were delivered. The recipients, both Professors of repute did not get it. These were books, each costing $32 plus shipping cost. Today, after reminders after reminders, Sendle sent me a note saying they would refund me $7 which does not even cover the two parcel shipping costs. What a joke ! I cannot reach them as all their so-called Customer Happiness Champions are Philippines-based and they have no idea about Australia. It is a scam, fraud, and full of deceptive conduct. There are no phone numbers I could call them. I asked them to call me.... no reply.They did not also respond to unlawful debit of my credit card on the plea that one of the parcels was bigger. It can't be as all my parcels were of the same size and weight.  They are nothing but thieves. If you ever have complaints to make and if you hear from these people ( Vera, Jackie, Paulo, and Ralph --- perhaps fake names), you can bet these are fake people from the Philippines. Stay away from Sendle. Go to Australia Post even if it costs you some extra dollars. I really wonder how on earth this fake, fraud and scam company can run in Australia.

This has been a terrible experience and I do not recommend this to anyone. I picked Sendle because the prices were cheaper than Australia Post and someone could pick up from my home. What a complete farce. Took money from me quickly enough but I'm still waiting on the service I paid for. I will be going back to Australia Post because at least they have 7 days a week customer service online and on the phone and they've always refunded me when I've been able to prove that issues were not my fault.I've had a few small parcels ready to go for nearly a week. The courier keeps marking that the pick up was 'futile' (which means the courier is saying they tried to pick up the items but were unable to...doesn't say why though). I carefully followed all the requirements for pick up and this keeps happening. No one has been to my home in the past week to pick up any parcels so either the system they use is faulty or someone is being dishonest. I have had parcels delivered from other couriers with no problem. Sendle customer service doesn't operate on weekends and it takes them 1-2 days to get back to you. Incredibly unprofessional and I will not be using them or recommending them to anyone.,"Sep 19, 2021",waste time money going consumer affair feel like scammed terrible experience recommend anyone picked sendle price cheaper australia post someone could pick home complete farce took money quickly enough still waiting service paid going back australia post least 7 day week customer service online phone always refunded able prove issue small parcel ready go nearly week courier keep marking pick mean courier saying tried pick item unable say though carefully followed requirement pick keep happening one home past week pick parcel either system use faulty someone dishonest parcel delivered courier problem sendle customer service operate weekend take day get back incredibly unprofessional using recommending anyone

1,Poor Experience with Sendle.,"My package was registered online with Sendle and left at the front door for collection with a Sendle label. Sendle sent a courier to collect the package, who did not arrive on the specified day. Sendle then sent a “dedicated” courier to collect the package the following day. When I checked with the recipient the following week I found that it was not delivered. I requested an investigation and Sendle denied that they had collected the package. Then Sendle also claimed that as it was not properly registered by their courier, they refused to send me insurance claim forms.  We were home during this entire period and never informed us of any problem. After 3 weeks, I  insisted on an additional search and to their credit the package actually turned up and was finally delivered a month late. So, in essence they collected the package, lost it, denied me the insurance cover that I paid for because they did not record the collection correctly. Significant failures for a courier company. They were difficult to communicate with, have no telephone contacts on their website and their “Customer Happiness Champions” were only interested in covering up Sendle’s failures. Will not be using them again.","Sep 16, 2021",package registered online sendle left front door collection sendle label sendle sent courier collect package arrive specified day sendle sent dedicated courier collect package following day checked recipient following week found delivered requested investigation sendle denied collected package sendle also claimed properly registered courier refused send insurance claim form home entire period never informed u problem 3 week insisted additional search credit package actually turned finally delivered month late essence collected package lost denied insurance cover paid record collection correctly significant failure courier company difficult communicate telephone contact website customer happiness champion interested covering sendle failure using

I get response can I ask how you know this? Umm I just told you...

I suspect that the lazy so-and-so of a driver simply drove past or perhaps didn't even do that. Contacted Sendle and it's clear that they have no ability to really do much to help as they are at the mercy of the courier company and they clearly have no influence or power in the matter.I like the idea of Sendle but you have no choice over the courier company and if you end up with someone rubbish like Aramex, there's not much they can do to help you.","Aug 4, 2021",booked something aramex supposed picked next day picked contacted told driver scanned turned collect package ready actually turned sitting room looking entrance property next door would knock suspect lazy driver simply drove past perhaps even contacted sendle clear ability really much help mercy courier company clearly influence power like idea sendle choice courier company end someone rubbish like aramex much help

This is just 1 example and an example of what I am currently going through. They are dishonest and will get out of any guarantee anyway they can.

1,Terrible - Avoid,"Review by Michael Pollak is spot on.Ordered Christmas gifts from a Melbourne vendor (I'm in Sydney) on the 29th November. Pick-up was scheduled for the 7th December, was not picked up. Picked up on the 8th and parcel has been ""in transit"" for a week. No updates since then. It is now past its due delivery date. And for Sendle to look into it will require another 5 business days. No number to call for assistance, emails take ages to get a response, meanwhile both the seller and I are in limbo. I don't even know where my parcel is or if I'm going to get these gifts in time for Christmas. Paid for delivery and this is what I got.AusPost is awful but at least you can follow up with them and as a corporation they have some accountability. Never ever use Sendle as a seller or buyer.Edited to add: Opened an investigation into it on Thursday a day after it was due to be delivered and after getting zero responses from customer service, today Sunday it was mysteriously ""found at depot"" and is now ""onboard for delivery"". God knows how long the parcel would have been stuck at the depot if they weren't forced to look into it? I have now spent half the day waiting for the package and am FUMING that I am now having to waste my Sunday at home waiting for this package that is already LATE. No tracking beyond ""in transit"" and ""on board for delivery"" the entire time, pathetic service why does a delivery company not have any kind of GPS tracking. I have no idea when the parcel is arriving and can't leave my house in case I miss it and the package is sent straight back to the vendor (this has also happened before since they have no distribution centre like AusPost). Sendle is absolutely trash, I've lost faith in the vendor as well for using them. Avoid at all costs, don't risk your business and customer service on this pathetic delivery service.","Updated Dec 20, 2020",review michael pollak spot christmas gift melbourne vendor sydney 29th november scheduled 7th december picked picked 8th parcel transit week update since past due delivery date sendle look require another 5 business day number call assistance email take age get response meanwhile seller limbo even know parcel going get gift time christmas paid delivery awful least follow corporation accountability never ever use sendle seller add opened investigation thursday day due delivered getting zero response customer service today sunday mysteriously found depot onboard delivery god know long parcel would stuck depot forced look spent half day waiting package fuming waste sunday home waiting package already late tracking beyond transit board delivery entire time pathetic service delivery company kind gps tracking idea parcel arriving ca leave house case miss package sent straight back vendor also happened since distribution centre like auspost sendle absolutely trash lost faith vendor well using avoid cost risk business customer service pathetic delivery service

We waited all day and the driver didn't turn up. Contacted the support people who said they would reschedule. Didn't get a confirmation email and my dashboard was not updated with new delivery details so I had to follow up with them. It's now past the pick-up cutoff time and again it hasn't been picked up with no communication from Sendle about it. Again I have emailed to find out what is happening. With no phone number to call it's very frustrating and not a good experience from a sender point of view. This is disappointing as we have found them quite good when we have received parcels.

I looked at the tracking and It said ""an attempt"" to pick up was made on the Tuesday (which is a crock of .. because the package had been sitting the same spot the other package was picked up from). So I contacted them since they have a 2 day pick up guarantee. I can tell you they have worded it so they never have to pay and never have to pick up your parcel. Since an ""attempt"" was made and re-scheduling was done for Wednesday, the pick up guarantee restarts again on Wednesday, so when it wasn't picked up on Wednesday they have Thursday to pick it up and say that they attempted and the cycle repeats itself.

Printed the docket and left it outside as per my instructions, as I usually do. I was informed via my dashboard later that evening that the parcel pickup was delayed and it would be rescheduled for Friday the 23rd. I was travelling intrastate on that day so left my gates open so the Couriers Please courier could get the parcel. I arrived back to the office on Monday the 26th to find I'd had a delivery from Couriers Please but the parcel I wanted to send was still sitting there. I lodged a customer enquiry stating the above, got the standard email reply that the couriers had been alerted and it would be rescheduled for pickup. The next day, Tuesday the 27th, it sat there all day and still wasn't picked up. I notified sendle again by replying to the previous days' email. No response has been rec'd from customer service at this point apart from the obligatory auto-response that the courier has been alerted to the issue. It's now Wednesday the 28th and it is still sitting at my despatch area and not a word from Sendle.I have used sendle for a fair while and I have given them 5 star reviews in the past but recently they have been really slow in getting parcels picked up.

This instance has been a week tomorrow that my parcel has been sitting here and no one from Sendle has made any contact with me for an apology or an explanation as to the delay. I'm not sure what part of the system has broken down but clearly, the organisation isn't what it was, so I will try and source something better from here on in.

They then tried a few hours later and had the same update. When this happened I sent an email enquiring about the issue. The following day they tried another 2 times, both with the same outcome. Getting pretty frustrated, I wanted some contact with Sendle as they had not gotten back to me, only to find out there was no phone number to call! I sent a message to them through Facebook but still no response. It was only after I had publicly commented on their Instagram post that I had any sort of contact with Sendle, days after the first contact I had made. Finally got to emailing them, and was then told it would take 1-2 days to re-deliver the parcel. I asked if there was any way it could come before the weekend as I had been waiting for days at this point, and their response was that there is no guarantee. I finally got my parcel today, after the 5th attempt and 6 days after the first delivery attempt when it should have arrived. Do not use Sendle, if anything goes wrong with the delivery process, their customer support is very much lacking, with no phone number to ring, no response from direct messages, and an email turnaround time of 2 days, unless you negatively comment on their Instagram post like I did (and many others too.

1,Sendle seem to have lost The Plot,"Sendle seem to have lost The Plot. I was impressed with their excellent service in the beginning and let people know. Sadly, I am unable to do that this time.Delivery was attempted on Sat 8th August. The Couriers Please driver left a TOTALLY BLANK calling card in my letterbox that I only discovered after a random check of the mailbox later that afternoon. The company had Authority To Leave The Parcel Safe If No One Home. I was home but the driver didn't care enough to slide the bolt on the gate to the right to enter the property and knock on my front door. After discovering the card, I was somewhat confused so checked my email. Eventually I received an email telling me their attempt to deliver had failed and they left me a card. The email advised that I had to request a redelivery with Authority To Leave.. (which they already had) So I went through the process, got told by return automated response that it would delay the delivery by one extra business day while my request was processed. So I accepted that would make it a Tuesday delivery. Afraid not, A further check of my email and there was an email informing me that they had delivered my parcel to their collection point in my area. So now I had to go and collect it. I eventually collected it on Thursday the 13th. Sendle sent me a further email late Thursday or Friday announcing that my parcel had been delivered and invited me to leave a review with a link to their website. The link failed to execute correctly. So not to be defeated, Here is the review Sendle so enthusiastically requested. On further investigation, I discovered that my parcel had been delivered to the collection point on the Saturday at around about the same time I was advised I would have to request a redelivery. What a pathetic display of incompetence. The thing is, I don't need Sendle to make my life more frustrating by taking the delivery booking then passing it on to Couriers Please. I wanted to ring Sendle on the Saturday but no number on offer. I can book my deliveries direct with Couriers Please and still get the same poor service because I've experienced it in the past. However, they at least offer a contact number should you need to call them. The poor service and appalling communication and incorrect advice from Sendle is common through the industry and it is slowly but surely undermining consumer confidence with purchasing on line. Delivery times are being extended and we must not lose sight of the fact that the consumer is paying for the poor delivery service. The seller of the product also takes a hit to their reputation as a result of Sendles (in this case) appalling service. Stop hiding behind the internet Sendle and talk to your customers. Make it easy for your customers to get information and advise you that you are performing poorly in instances such as my recent experience.","Aug 16, 2020",sendle seem lost plot impressed excellent service beginning let people know sadly unable attempted sat 8th august courier please driver left totally blank calling card letterbox discovered random check mailbox later afternoon company authority leave parcel safe one home home driver care enough slide bolt gate right enter property knock front door discovering card somewhat confused checked email eventually received email telling attempt deliver failed left card email advised request redelivery authority leave already went process got told return automated response would delay delivery one extra business day request processed accepted would make tuesday delivery afraid check email email informing delivered parcel collection point area go collect eventually collected thursday 13th sendle sent email late thursday friday announcing parcel delivered invited leave review link website link failed execute correctly defeated review sendle enthusiastically requested investigation discovered parcel delivered collection point saturday around time advised would request redelivery pathetic display incompetence thing need sendle make life frustrating taking delivery booking passing courier please wanted ring sendle saturday number offer book delivery direct courier please still get poor service experienced past however least offer contact number need call poor service appalling communication incorrect advice sendle common industry slowly surely undermining consumer confidence purchasing line delivery time extended must lose sight fact consumer paying poor delivery service seller product also take hit reputation result sendles case appalling service stop hiding behind internet sendle talk customer make easy customer get information advise performing poorly instance recent experience

1,As An Ebayer,"As An Ebayer, I thought It would be good to save customers money for shipping.Worst Mistake I could have made !!- No pick ups for over a week after marked  for shipping !!   ( I suspect every-time you add another parcel they   delay the pick up to save money )- Customers Complaining- Lost Parcels- No Driver ( Fastway Reporting for pick ups )- No Phone Service- Parcels sitting Idle going nowhereEven after reporting issues to Ebay and directly to the management of Sendle ( yes personally communicated with me as I forced a contact through Linked In ), all promises to resolve issues fell on deaf ears.Their contact with Fastway is so Poor, I accidentally bumped into the driver making another delivery aver the road and he was unaware he had 12 parcels across the road to pick up. Other times the driver thinks he had one parcel when there were up to 16 parcels to be picked up. ( this would be more proof the reporting system is not advising the driver of the correct number of parcels to be collected if they get the advice at all !! )You cannot fix a broke system if you simply cannot be bothered but like I stated to Sendle, without a phone service to resolve these issues, they will never be a real delivery service that can compete with the slightly more expensive Australia Post.I cannot see how they were integrated into Ebay with such poor service, even when they fail to pick up after days, you cannot use the same label to take to a drop off centre !! I gave them a good go and a lot of constructive feedback, all that was totally ignored with political automated email answers.Dont waste your time if you want reliability.My experience is based on sending 187 parcels with SENDLE in the last 5 months and sending over 500 with AUS Post in the same time frame.","Jul 7, 2020",ebayer thought would good save customer money mistake could made pick ups week marked shipping suspect add another parcel delay pick save money customer lost driver fastway reporting pick ups phone parcel sitting idle going nowhereeven reporting issue ebay directly management sendle yes personally communicated forced contact linked promise resolve issue fell deaf contact fastway poor accidentally bumped driver making another delivery aver road unaware 12 parcel across road pick time driver think one parcel 16 parcel picked would proof reporting system advising driver correct number parcel collected get advice fix broke system simply bothered like stated sendle without phone service resolve issue never real delivery service compete slightly expensive australia see integrated ebay poor service even fail pick day use label take drop centre gave good go lot constructive feedback totally ignored political automated email waste time want experience based sending 187 parcel sendle last 5 month sending 500 au post time frame

Two weeks after the item was due to be delivered, it hadn't arrived, so I contacted the buyer. The buyer contacted Sendle to chase and it was only then that they bothered investigating. The day after the investigation the parcel finally moved and I got it the day after that. Tracking revealed they'd had the parcel for at least half a month but had done nothing at all until the dispute had been raised. If I hadn't raised a dispute and the seller hadn't chased I guess it'd have sat their forever. So not only was the parcel late, Sendle either have no way of checking in on undelivered parcels or just don't care.","May 23, 2020",ordered ebay item delivered sendle two week item due delivered arrived contacted buyer buyer contacted sendle chase bothered investigating day investigation parcel finally moved got day tracking revealed parcel least half month done nothing dispute raised raised dispute seller chased guess sat forever parcel late sendle either way checking undelivered parcel care

Are the vans not GPS TRACKED? Sendle want you to pull yourself away from running your business for a service in which you are paying for to investigate for them how the FASTWY DRIVER is lying AND incompetent.4-	Sendles customer service is SLOW and Appalling, they do not have a contact number, to raise a complaint you need to email Sendle then wait 24hrs for a reply, far toooooo long if you have an disgruntled customer.Sendle obviously do not value you as a customer as much as you value you own customers.Also, if your payment declines for some reason, Sendle lock you out completely, you cannot go back and view past PAID FOR deliveries or Deliveries currently in transit, surely this is against consumer law.There are many more services apart from sendle, Sendle may offer good rates, but when there is an issue, it becomes very costly.This is a reply to Sendle's responseWow, this is unbelievable that you have been able to reply so quickly to a negative review. Usually it takes 24 hours just to receive a response to a complaint, so this is a record and a first for Sendle.

I booked a job to be picked up on the 4th of Jan. After it didn't get picked up we saw an automatic status that said as much and that it was being rebooked for the next day. However, still no pickup, so by the middle of the 3rd day, we sent a support enquiry asking what's going on. Sendle replied they are escalating with the pickup provider. By 8th of Jan, we had enough and cancelled the order. Our customer has been chasing delivery of their much needed items and this is reflecting poorly on us. All claims about sending a dedicated pickup driver never eventuated. This is false advertising and I'm pretty sure it's illegal to make such claims and not follow through. If Couriers Please (their pickup partner) is not up to the task, they should stop using Couriers Please and switch companies. Surely, such bad practices would leave customers with a bad taste in the mouth and in turn result in negative feedback (like this). Or maybe, they simply don't want to service small businesses, despite their claims otherwise.All in all, very, very bad experience.","Feb 7, 2020",extremely disappointed service initially attracted sendle due pickup guarantee false claim booked job picked 4th get picked saw automatic status said much rebooked next day however still pickup middle 3rd day sent support enquiry asking going sendle replied escalating pickup provider 8th jan enough cancelled order customer chasing delivery much needed item reflecting poorly u claim sending dedicated pickup driver never eventuated false advertising pretty sure illegal make claim follow courier please pickup partner task stop using courier please switch company surely bad practice would leave customer bad taste mouth turn result negative feedback like maybe simply want service small business despite claim bad experience

I said I had been home and no one entered my property, advised the address was correct and provided the information that was requested.

Are you serious, you don’t even bother to try and resolve the situation and are perfectly happy to lose a customer, obviously if this isn’t resolved I wouldn’t return and would leave negative feedback and that’s the kind of thing you are content with? I said just to clarify the only way I can send is with my item being picked up and you can’t guarantee it will, and I was just advised I can drop off, but I would have to cancel this order, print another label and book to have my item dropped off.

1,7 days wasted on waiting and praying for pickup,"Hmm... 6 days now, and my parcel is still sitting at the front door waiting. I wonder someone from the neighborhood may even act quicker than Sendle, and take it before them show up..Still, today there’s no one showed up after the 6th time I scheduled/rescheduled the pick up. Don’t know whether tomorrow will have any luck They should really put this on the headline of their website, “we guarantee it takes at least 7days to pick up ur parcel”.And still haven’t seen any of their so-called dedicated driver, who supposed to come the first time when they missed it. I don’t know why they make it sound like such a great privilege and bonus of their service, as they resend someone to pick it up if it doesn’t get collected on the first place.Come on! You’re a courier, that’s what the customers pay for: PICK UP THE PARCEL! So of course you’re gonna re-attempt if you didn’t even come pick up on the scheduled date (don’t tell me the customers should pay extra, when you didn’t even show up).

When people have a positive feedback, most of them may share with their friends in life, but they won’t be bothered to go on websites, register/log in, and then write a review about it.Most of the case, people will only go through these pains when they’re really upset about some terrible service/quality, and they can’t wait to let out their anger & warn others.Just saying, many positive reviews are written by people who only write 1 REVIEW, and that review is an absolutely AMAZING experience with sendle.They would register an account just to appraise sendle?????

To that end when there is none, e.g. Christmas, they will struggle to achieve it.Second, you get a lower price but they are not an express delivery service. If capacity is low parcels can get delayed. If you need certainty of time, use another provider.Similarly, if your business is sending hundreds of parcels a month, Sendle may not be the right option. You may be able to build a relationship with an alternate provider with small if any pricing differential.Unfortunately their dependence on third parties has its own complexity but overall so far the service has been what they said.

1,My advice AVOID Sendle.  Not reputable & No integrity,"My advice, AVOID Sendle.  We’ve had them here in Australia for some time and now their expanding to ruin people’s days across the US.

Sendle will drop you quicker than a hot potato.

1,Sendle is an absolute DISGRACE - Never Use - Avoid,"The worst courier I have ever experienced, failed to deliver my item.DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY AS A SELLER OR PURCHASER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.    I will never purchase an item on-line from any seller who uses this company as their courier.  This company did not deliver my item to my address - 17 days late & still no delivery.  Attempted to deliver my package to a large private school's kindergarten instead of my clearly marked residential address.   Sendle is an absolute disgrace.04/01/2020Please have a look below at Sendle's further incompetence, asking me for their Order Reference Number. I am not surprised this only further demonstrates that Sendle don't know their business and it is now that they want to communicate.   Sendle, I don't work for you, I ordered an item from Mr Pool Man who used Sendle as a courier.   Sendle's job was to collect a package on 16/12/2019 & deliver said package by 18/12/2019.   The item was attempted to be delivered to a kindergarten across the road of my premises with a different address, then taken back because it was the wrong address.You did not want to communicate to solve this problem with anything except token gestures at the time you lost my package, please do not send me any more requests to do your work, like you are doing now.   I am still awaiting to hear from Mr Pool Man in regard to being reimbursed for my order which I cancelled.Sendle, can you please respond publicly on this site and tell me where the package is, where is it you say it was delivered & who signed for it.?    Let the readers here decide who is telling the truth.01/06/2020Sendle, yes I have received contact from Your Customer Support Champion Farah, who has just stated that 19 days after delivery date she is going to talk to the courier driver, and this could take 5 days.   Not good enough.   Would have been nice if this was done on the day, could have avoided a lot of issues.   She informs that Sendle have a policy of leaving parcels at addresses other than the destination address.   You are going to need negative stars in your feedback request for customers to accurately describe your courier business quality of service.   Would be good if your drivers knew the difference between a private residence and a large private school complex, where they originally attempted to deliver.  Not good enough, disgraceful customer service, nowhere near good enough. You still have not responded to my questions above, in this public forum, to let the people decide on how you conduct your business.Sendle, can you please respond publicly on this site and tell me where the package is, where is it you say it was delivered & who signed for it.?    Let the readers here decide who is telling the truth====================================================11/01/2020 - latest email to the Sendle.   People You Decide - as a seller if you value your clients; as a purchaser - you want a reliable & ethical courier.Farah, (Sendles' Customer Happiness Champion)Have you found the package yet?Can you tell me if it was delivered?  if so;Can you tell me where it was delivered?Can you tell me who signed for it?These are simple questions, that only need simple replies.   Sendle, you collected the parcel on 16/01/2019, it is now 11/01/2020, still no answers in sight.   I am being asked by Mr Pool Man to return the item for a refund for a parcel you delivered to the wrong address 23/12/2019, then took the parcel away cause it needed to be signed for, then on 02/01/2020 you inform me it has been delivered and you have not provided me with where it was delivered to & inform me it has not been signed for.   (long after I cancelled the order).   It is apparent that Sendle appears to have no influence over the drivers who deliver for Sendle & it appears that the drivers will break the rule and not obtain signatures for deliveries.   This can be cleared up by answering the above 4 questions.   If you continue to avoid the questions with token answers, the people on the review page will know that your honesty and integrity will be measured by your avoidance to directly respond to fair and reasonable questions of your conduct.   Or Sendle can continue to demonstrate your disgraceful ethics by not answering questions that all customers and their clients would like to know about Sendle as a courier management company.   The seller, Mr Pool Man has lost patience with you as I have a number of emails detailing what your customer thinks of Sendle and your complete incompetence.   So stop giving me token reply’s, just answer my questions directly.   Time to do the right thing and admit that your company cannot even fulfill its core duties, being able to pick up a parcel and delivering it to a customer of your client.   COMPLETE FAIL.Please stop telling me that you will not contact me, that I need to go to your site to find out information about Sendle not doing its job, that I should search my neighborhood to find a package, that you have failed to deliver to my address.   I Don’t Work For You.   In fact Sendle was employed to deliver a package by Mr Pool Man (who you work for) and deliver it to me (Mr Pool Mans client.)I will await your response to these 4 simple questions Fahar – Not sure how you became a Customer Happiness Champion?   Time for Sendle to demonstrate some integrity.Sendle – Unreliable - Un-Contactable – Much Dumber that Ordinary PostWarren FRANCIS-PESTER====================================================19/01/2020Sendle, thank you for contacting me privately on my email, however, I like to keep my review of you in the public forum.   I just want to provide facts and then let the public decide how your performance as courier service rates.Summary Of Facts:1.   Purchased pool filter from Mr Pool Man 15/12/2019 (10 days before Xmas)2.   Sendle collected item on 16/12/20193.   Mr Pool Man's informed me that delivery would be on 18/12/20194.   Via email, 20/12/2019, checked with Mr Pool Man why parcel has not arrived - informed due to bush fires NSW a delay of 2-3 days.   No problem delivery date now expected to be 21/12/2019 - still in time fro xmas.5.   In the mean time, checked reviews on Sendle as a courier company - Reviews were scathing from purchases & sellers6.   Checked Sendle tracking on 24/12/2019 (1 day before xmas) - Informed parcel delivered, not left by Sendle, tried to deliver item to large private school, they could not obtain signature, took item away.   7.   Sendles tracking site informed me that a card had been left & to arrange re-delivery.   (Sendle later admitted in an email - that the card was left in the couriers truck at the wrong address)8.   I attempted to contact Sendle immediately, they do have provide a phone number anywhere to contact them.   I was informed by Sendle that this their policy in relation telephone calls.   You may only have contact with Sendle via a web page.   This leads to unnecessary delays.9.  According to Sendles tracking, my parcel was on the truck on 27/12/2019 and returned to the depot on 30/12/2019.   No cards left, they appear to have tried to deliver to the same private school, which is not open due to the xmas break.   Again no cards let at my address.10.   On 28/12/2019, I cancelled the order, notifying Mr Pool Man and requested a refund.   i went and purchased this item locally.11.   On 02/01/2020, i was informed via Sendle's tracking site that the item was deliver.   NOT AT MY HOUSE.   I was home.10.   I was informed by Sendle that the item was left without signature, maybe at a neighbors,  maybe under a tree and that I should search around my neighborhood.   I could not understand why Sendle refused to leave the item without signature on two occasions and the third occasion, they decided to leave this anywhere.   I did not authorise  delivery without signature.11.   They declared that their investigation was concluding, I have received not information of the results of their investigation & have asked them to provide me with answers to 4 simple questions: (i) Have you found the package yet?(ii) Can you tell me if it was delivered?  if so;(iii) Can you tell me where it was delivered?(iv)Can you tell me who signed for it?After a thorough investigation - these answers should be easy & I would like them in the public forum for all people to know.   It appears that Sendle do not like to be transparent to questions that are like to be damaging facts.12.   According to their webpage again my parcel has been declared lost, and they are providing the seller with information on how to claim a refund.  13. I contacted Mr Pool Man with copy of this email and it was at this point Mr Pool Man then provided me with a refund - 14/01/2020.  I dealt with Kc, Farah, Krystel & Rytz (Customer support Champions & manages) all useless.   It appears that they like to ask questions of recipients, but do not like to answer questions of recipients.   Sendle appear to have no moral compass, avoid responsibility and provide their clients customers with token gesture responses instead of serious answers to difficult questions in the public forum.Sendle is a disgrace as a courier firm and any business that subjects their customers to Sendle is also responsible for poor customer service.   Avoid Sendle, not should not even be a consideration for sellers or buyers.Warren Francis-Pester====================================================Hi Sendle & your Customer Happiness Champions - You say that you have conducted an investigations, still waiting for a reply in the public forum to the result of your investigation.   You have gone very quiet.   You also have failed to answer my questions for the public to see.

Elected drop off point. Dropped off same day. Two weeks later had not been picked up. Launched an investigation through Sendle web platform. Came back a week later 'after a thorough investigation (?), we are unable to find package'.I personally went to the drop off point and found the package within 10 seconds. I spoke to the management of the establishment and NO INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT (Strike 1: Blatant lying). I asked the attendant at the drop off point what happened. They informed that Sendle had not given them access to the POS equipment to register package but still for some reason accepted the package. This depot was listed as a point on Sendle's website (Stike 2: Ineffective service).I responded to the ticket letting them know what happened. TWO WEEKS later had not been picked up yet! (Strike 3: Terrible problem resolution). On the plus side, instantly refunded postage cost. Not really sure why they would do that if they had any intention of carrying out the duty.

This was ordered on 5 December for Christmas so I had assumed that would be plenty of time, boy what a mistake, didn't realise at the time the seller wasn't using Auspost as the expected delivery date was 12-13 December on the sellers site.

I contacted support who were basically useless. Pick ups should be prioritised after something like this happens but there was no such assistance.I thought it would be attempted the next day because they say they'll come the next day if not collected initially but apparently I needed to reschedule because the driver was hopeless. So another day wasted. New scheduled pick up day was Thursday, again nothing.

1,BEWARE!... They lie and use the most imcompetent couriers on earth!!,"Where do I start... I purchased an Item online and received the Sendle Tracking no. All seemed good at first, 6 days went by and I noticed not one single scan on the tracking. I then contacted Sendle to voice my concern on the lack of tracking and was told they can see tracking on their end and it had passed through Gold Coast to Bendigo depot. That was a flat out lie as I discovered later. I waited and when the expected delivery time had passed I lodged an investigation (Which can take 8 days) and as the days went on, there was still no scanning so I kept voicing my concern and asking where it was and to at least give me an ETA. Still the answer I kept getting was that they couldn't tell me anything new. I then requested the courier service and consignment number which turned out to be the most useless couriers on earth...Fastway. When I checked the consignment on Fastway it said it was scanned and headed to Launceston in Tasmania over 10 days ago. So Sendle straight out lied to me when they could see through Fastway it had gone there right from the day it was picked up, not Bendigo. Don't trust these lying pieces of rubbish with your parcel. This is a $600 Item and it's missing from day one. If they had just been honest and said we stuffed up and we're trying to get it back, I wouldn't be so upset. This investigation they launch is also complete rubbish designed to buy them an extra 8 days to locate and get the parcel to you. The investigation claimed they had interviewed drivers and checked vans. What an absolute lie! It had already gone to Tasmainia, so why couldn't you have told me? Just Beware, they use Fastway and another complete incompetent courier service called Couriers Please.

1,Customer Service.....What Customer Service?,"I'm all for industry disrupters & trying something new. So I thought I'd try Sendle with a personal package before shifting my business across. Well this potential new customer has definitely been lost. My package was due to be picked up on 17/9 between 8am-4pm. At 4:40pm no sign of courier so check my Sendle dashboard says pick rescheduled for 18/9. Oh well these thing happen I thought, & proceeded to go to an appointment leaving my house at 5:15pm. As new customer next morning thought I'd better check dashboard to see if there is anything I need to do with new pick up date - then see new status 'Futile Pickup sender not home'  WHAT!!! emailed sendle advised me they had rescheduled pick up for 19/9. Anyway with a number of emails back & forth I was disappointed to find out that Sendle do not honour their PICK-UP GUARANTEE. Apparently the courier had tried to pick up package ( but this was outside of Sendles service times 8am-4pm) but because they had tried to collect guarantee doesn't  seem to apply. All very convenient if you ask me. Why is the customer being penalised for the courier not operating within Sendles designated pick-up times. If your couriers can't work within the outlined Sendle service delivery standards that is not the fault of the customer. Sendle I am super disappointed. Your customers service & resolution process is abysmal - avoidance of answering direct questions, no explanation as to why a pickup scheduled for 17/9 is now going to be pick-up 19/9 two days later.

1,"A very poor domestic service, let down by sub-standard delivery partners","We trialed Sendle for sending domestic Australian orders from our online store a few years ago. In the first week there were so many issues and we spent so much time trying to solve them that it became immediately apparent that it wasn't a great service. The problem seemed to be the delivery partners, in our area they are Couriers Please and Fastway. They weren't even bothering to attempt to deliver parcels in some cases. After about 3 issues in a week we canned Sendle and let their customer service know how bad our experience was and they were very apologetic and took our feedback on board. Cut to 2019 and their international service is better, but the domestic service is still TERRIBLE. As of today I've waited three days for a courier to pick up a parcel from our premises where I've been in attendance the entire time. On the third day the courier has 'attempted' a pick-up which is a complete lie - nobody rocked up and I suspect it's Couriers Please attempting to cover themselves with their client Sendle, while Sendle are powerless to do anything over a third party driver/franchisee. Their customer service is too slow to respond to issues so when things do go wrong you're basically on your own.

It disappeared for large periods of time because it went to Germany for some bizarre reason, hugely adding to the delay. And the support response was a joke when queried about it, not to mention their KB/documentation is awful about actually figuring out which carrier has it so you can get proper information. In future I will just go direct, why have Sendle take a cut off the top like a wholesaler when they can't even provide any actual value on top.And a package I am still yet to receive, from the east coast to Perth, 1-4 days shipping, 5 business days later, still not here, and still no tracking about where it is. Latest update I have was that it was picked up. But from the sounds of the reviews on here, that's actually pretty impressive, that it was actually picked up.

I finally got an email from Sendle today, telling me they can't find the parcel, they can't do any more for me and to contact Who Gives A Crap to arrange a replacement to be sent out. The hilarious part is that I spoke to Who Gives A Crap just over a week ago now, they apologised and said they would send a replacement out (I'm assuming via Sendle). The replacement was supposed to arrive mid last week. Guess what? This one hasn't arrived either!The staff at Sendle seem very nice but I can't give them more than one star as they literally have one job - to move parcels between the sender and the receiver and it doesn't appear they are very good at doing that.","Jan 15, 2018",ordered box ethical toilet paper give crap delivery estimated arrive 15 19 parcel arrive assumed everyone busy christmas gave day grace following told assigned job fastaway fastaway know parcel gone would look getting update every day since late december 15 jan telling looking parcel get back soon finally got email sendle today telling ca find parcel ca contact give crap arrange replacement sent hilarious part spoke give crap week ago apologised said would send replacement assuming via sendle replacement supposed arrive mid last week guess one arrived either staff sendle seem nice ca give one star literally one job move parcel sender receiver appear good
1,I would not even give them 1 star and I …,I would not even give them 1 star and I urge you not to use them2 out of 2 (separate) orders have disappeared and there is no way of tracking them.  Once Sendle flicks the parcel off to a third party the tracking number becomes worthless.  You can't phone them and they DO NOT reply to emails.  No customer service. No goods.  Sender is refunding my parcels and I will not use them again because of Sendle,"Dec 2, 2017",would even give 1 star urge use them2 2 separate order disappeared way tracking sendle flick parcel third party tracking number becomes worthless ca phone reply email customer service good sender refunding parcel use sendle
