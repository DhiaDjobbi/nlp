1,"Not reliable, late delivery and zero communication","Worst experience with a delivery agency! I was able to choose a locker for my delivery, but the parcel needed a signature and it was not delivered. At no point was this communicated nor did I receive any notification, the package just did not come.I then had to create an account (?!) just to be able to select a different pickup point, which they take one whole working day to process.Still waiting for my package….",2025-01-31 17:59:08,ES
1,Ups Jönköping has workers that steal,"Ups Jönköping has workers that steal. They stole my package for my father for Christmas.

1,Horrible experience that ruined me…,Horrible experience that ruined me completely. Very heartless company ! Never again will I use your services. I relocated to a different country and they didn’t deliver all my packages I kept following up through the third party company I booked. They kept messing me about for more than one month only to turn round and send a stupid email that a claim has been sent. I wondered what that meant and I’ve been told the items were declared unrecoverable. This company has left bitter memories from this experience. I had personal priced possessions that I had for years for myself and my son but they never took it serious to help. When I call the number it is very difficult to get across to anybody and it is only recorded messages. The experience has now sent me into depression! If I ever don’t recover the items I can’t imagine starting all over to buy the items I can’t get them back.,2025-01-31 22:32:44,US

Days lost wages and MAYBE not getting parcel.",2025-01-29 19:35:20,GB
1,Horrible. Avoid using!!!!!!!!,Had three packages due for delivery.All of the packages arrived to destination city hub early in the morning. Two of the three packages were put on the delivery vehicle and one was not. Half way through the day an update is sent stating that the third package had been delayed due to severe weather. Called 800 number to find out why. The operator was of no help just telling me that all they see is a weather delay. The town that the package is currently in is 70 degrees and sunny. UPS used to be good but they have slipped dramatically. They need to get back to the basics.,2025-01-31 01:33:41,US

Returned home to find 3 notifications - no dates on any of them - but all saying packages was delivered to local access point on Monday. We returned the following Friday; the local access point  had not got it. UPS (and its difficult to actually speak to anyone)initially said it was delivered then agreed to re-arrange delivery. So clearly they still have it and a driver had fabricated the delivery (including a false name of someone who received it) and entered it into the system. Always a problem with UPS, far and away the worst delivery operation.",2025-01-31 17:09:13,GB

1,Worst Mail Carrier in Current Operation,I have never had a UPS package arrive on time.  Their website tracking system blatantly lies about delivery times.  Their customer service consists of an AI chatbot that is utterly braindead and can only respond to 4-5 prompts with the same answers over and over.  If you try hard enough you may actually be able to connect to a real customer service agent who will tell you to get rocked and not fix a thing about the issue you're having.,2025-01-28 01:44:22,US

Apparantly it is not possible to pay with paypal if you select delivery to a UPS deposit point. Workaround: select the address of the same UPS deposit and do not select the checkbox. I can only say that I see no logic in these kind of 'rules' and it is very energy consuming to figure this out since it is impossible to save a shipment (5 pages to be filled in) before finishing it.

Always delayed, bad tracking systems (i prefer after ship app to check more precisely), items always stuck for ""unexpected"" reasons (LOLLLL), their service has turned into a joke. plus they are very costly for the disappointing service they provide. They create negative impact to the buyer's experience that reflects on the merchants, too.The only good thing i can say is for their staff who are always so polite and well mannered.

I asked for specifics and they played dumb blaming the merchant. We are not children. Grow up and do the job you get paid to horribly do. If I wanted to hear someone blame someone else and lack accountability, I'd call an ex. Stop outsourcing and actually get people who WANT to do their job.

Today is the 28th of January - UPS said they would deliver today and even sent me an email regarding such confirming that they would deliver today.

I think UPS has reached new lows in customer service and overall delivery.  We ship using them and have for over a decade, and all I can say is that the lies we have been told since shipping a package January 10, 2025 are outrageous and even their own system is in dispute with the words of their agents.  They have a package that has not delivered for nearly three weeks, and no one knows anything. They continue lying, stalling, claiming it is in Customs when their systems show it cleared January 13.  Call after call promises of calls back never happening! Day after day, lie after lie and our customer still does not have the package and we do not have any information about why.  It is an outrage.  I have now reached out to Corporate executives with details of the pathetic handling of this package.  I still have no answers and all anyone at UPS seems to want to do is nothing or to blame someone or something else.  IF Customs has a package and they need something, reach out to us and ask for the something.  But NOTHING!!!",2025-01-27 22:44:06,US

She said if the driver was already passed my place it would get delivered the next day. I checked the tracking the next day and it said the package was being returned to sender. I called UPS again and asked why. They claimed it was because the sender refused to allow the address to be changed by UPS. I contacted the sender and they stated that UPS lied to me. They verified by informing me that there was a location code attached to my package that states the package can be delivered. Now I must wait another week to receive my package as I have to wait for a refund then reorder my item. This is unacceptable. UPS has delivered to my address numerous times with no issues before with one exception of leaving my package at a neighbors because the driver claimed he couldn't tell an i from an L on my address.

Called to the US and they are calling Ireland to find out what is going on but have no information. At the same time, I had another package coming, UPS confirmed on the call and I can see it online that someone tried to deliver but couldn't because of non payment.  This time there is no call that I show and no notice in the mailbox.  I would not have known there was an issue unless I called in to track down my package.

Now UPS is claiming 'extreme weather conditions,' so it will not make it on time again even though I already extended my wait time. Looks like I have to reschedule my flight AGAIN.

This is completely frustrating, as I expected the parcel to be delivered directly to me first.Now, I have to go through the original sender to resolve this issue. I don't understand why the delivery service chose not to deliver to my address from the start. Additionally, when I contacted customer service for a resolution, I was directed to overseas representatives who could not assist me. I expressed my situation, including my disabilities and the challenges I face with limited mobility, but they reiterated that the only way to address this issue is via email.

1,UPS is absolutely terrible,"By no means am I an Amazon fan, but it's absolutely ridiculous how Amazon can deliver same-day, 1 day, and at worst 3 day deliveries consistently and at a much higher volume, while UPS, USPS, and FedEx can't even deliver a package within their estimated time window (which is typically set 7-10 days out)...Even, when the package reaches the destination city, UPS (and USPS, FedEx etc.) still generally take 2-3 days to deliver a package. Even when a package goes out for delivery and UPS (etc.) set a delivery time window, they almost never actually deliver within that window...I stayed home (on my one day of this month) waiting on a delivery this morning which was supposedly out for delivery by 7:00AM and which had a 7:15AM - 11:15AM delivery window, only for the delivery window to come and go with no package. I updated the the tracking at 12:15PM (one hour past the delivery window) and still showed the original delivery window. I then requested another update and now the delivery window changed to 7:00PM...This happened on nearly every delivery I had over the Xmas delivery period as well... I took those windows with a grain of salt due to the increased deliveries I expect UPS to have been dealing with over the holidays, but now at the end of January, I would expect UPS to have been caught up and to be able to give an accurate delivery window...Needless to say, I will be minimizing my orders from companies that use UPS, as much as possible...If your company doesn't have an Amazon store front, odds are that I don't need your product and won't be ordering from you.I hate Amazon to be honest, and would gladly jump ship if another company could fix the delivery time issues that plague every company not shipping with Amazon....But....Currently, Amazon can deliver within their estimated time windows, don't require signatures, will deliver inside of my garage, hide their packages left at my doorstep, and plain deliver quicker than any other company...Amazon took a loss on their deliveries, while they worked on building their infrastructure....UPS already has the infrastructure and profit margin (plus reserves)....UPS, get your act together...",2025-01-28 22:42:14,US

Finally after talking to multiple support people for over an hour they decided to reroute it to me again. My shipping details never updated until day before delivery which said 7pm. No delivery was ever attempted and delivery details were then unavailable. Then I call support and they said they tried to deliver the next day after it was supposed to be here at 11am. Now saying it'll be 3 days until they can deliver it and it'll be middle of the day (hopefully at the correct time) in which I work a 9-5.

I bought directly through UPS.I provided the correct values, the correct HS codes, and I would have provided invoices if I could have.The items have 0% duty and 0% ad valorem. I was expecting to pay VAT (should be 15%).BUT - hidden charges meaning they want me to pay effectively an extra 72% and 55% of the value of the item! (they call them ""Disbursement Fee"" and ""Brokerage Administration Charges"").I have dealt with plenty of imports with different shipping companies. Taking a little extra to process the customs is not unheard of - typically, including VAT this gets to about 20-30% of the item value (including the 15% VAT).... These fees are **KNOWN** by UPS when they provide the initial charges .... yet they hide them.",2025-01-16 10:52:55,ZA
1,Tired of THE UPS BULLS!T Excuses,"When you send a notice out like this ""Uncontrollable events have delayed delivery. We are adjusting delivery plans as quickly as possible. Please check back on the next business day for updates"" why don't UPS just tell us what that Uncontrollable event was? Is it because you guys screwed up and don't want to tell us? I know if it is the weather you guys usually tell us its because of the weather. When you don't tell us I guarantee the majority of the people automatically think you guys screwed up. I got yet another one of these notices today and it says my package will now be delivered which is a lie. I get told all the time that my package will be delivered on a Saturday but I do not recall of ever getting a Saturday delivery. It is hard enough to get you guys to deliver on Fridays. I am guessing it is because I live in the country and your drivers are ready to start their weekend and just blow me off. We all know they will not go out on a Saturday. You see, living in the country I have to use a deep water water well. It has been down going on three weeks now and that means I have been without water for three weeks. the part to fix my well was suppose to have been here tomorrow but ""an uncontrollable event"" has delayed delivery by a day. It states it will be here Saturday but like I said, I have never gotten a Saturday delivery on any occasion so now I have to wait until Monday. That is a bunch of bullsh!t. Why don't you just put my package on your plane and get it here instead of making me wait an additional three days for something that is your fault. This crap happens quite often and it is getting old.UPDATEThis morning, I checked the UPS tracking system to obtain an update on the status of my package, which is essential for restoring functionality to my water well. Regrettably, the tracking information merely indicated that uncontrollable events had caused a delay in my shipment, without providing further details. This marks the second delay in the delivery process. Upon contacting UPS via Facebook, their representative informed me that the package is currently located in New Mexico. Given that Saturday is a non-delivery day if a package is coming to my house for some reason, I inquired about the possibility of picking up the package at their warehouse, a procedure I have had to undertake multiple times in the past. The representative suggested that I request the package be redirected to an access point, where I could retrieve it from a locker, and provided a phone number for me to call to arrange this. However, he noted that this would result in an additional day's delay, making the estimated delivery date Monday, as UPS does not deliver to access points on Sundays. Furthermore, he stated that he was unable to facilitate this change due to the lack of a payment mechanism. I expressed surprise at this policy, questioning why UPS would charge me for expedited delivery when their own delays, for which they have not provided a reason, have already caused significant inconvenience. The representative confirmed that this was indeed their policy. This experience has led me to conclude that UPS, like many large corporations, prioritizes profit over customer satisfaction. It appears that they are willing to sacrifice individual customers, as the loss of business would be negligible to them. This approach is reminiscent of other large businesses, such as Walmart and Amazon, which seem to adopt a similar stance. While I acknowledge that UPS may assume I will continue to utilize their services due to the limited alternatives, I am disappointed that companies of their caliber have compromised the quality of the shopping experience. Ultimately, I hope that corporations like UPS will reassess their priorities and strive to provide better customer service. I really hope they hit hard times and going out of business.",2025-01-31 21:53:24,US

While out the night before, the driver came to the house a day early, and left a note saying they would take it to an access point (an access point 4+ miles away from my house, when the UPS facility is less than 1/2 mile from my house - which makes no sense to begin with). However, the driver did not drop it off that night, nor did it get dropped off the next day, and now the status on the package was changed from ""being dropped off at access point"" to ""unknown delay in network; unable to currently give update"". The dude absolutely stole my very nice, very expensive computer and is gaming the system to get away with it. News will be called, and lawyers will be hired.

This delay caused significant disruption to his treatment and caused immense stress and anxiety.While other carriers like Amazon and USPS have consistently delivered packages on time, UPS continues to fail to meet basic service expectations. I urge businesses to reconsider their use of UPS and choose more reliable shipping partners.UPS needs to be held accountable for its poor performance and take concrete steps to improve its service quality.

That’s interesting because I’m retired disabled veteran that’s home all the time and at 3:15 when I got the message From Amazon to call UPS I was home. That was about 15 minutes ago. Amazon confirmed that UPS was full of crap. Amazon called UPS and I’m sure gave them a scolding. I’ve dealt with this before on occasion in Oklahoma and Texas where UPS claims that they made a delivery attempt but I was always home or my family was home. UPS you have been caught in another lie big surprise. Amazon has confirmed that you’re lying. And now Amazon is trying to get my package which I have to wait another three days to get because you claimed on your UPS share post posting and Tracking that package was undeliverable. Incorrect address but Amazon confirmed that I’ve had the same address for almost 6 months here in Tombstone, Arizona liar liar liar pants on fire you’ve been caught with your pants around your ankles once again  🤮😡🤬😤",2025-01-18 00:33:30,US

1,I’ve always had issues with this…,"I’ve always had issues with this company, despite not using them very often. A previous mishap I had were the driver delivered to a nearby house, instead of where I lived, so I went online to use the assistant. The automated assistant basically told me: “The package was delivered, so there’s nothing we can do! But, why don’t you try calling customer service? They will give you more options.”So, I did. And this is basically what a live person in customer service had to say: “The package was delivered, so there’s nothing we can do! But, why don’t you try using our automated chat service? It will give you more options!” UPS loves to pass the blame so they won’t actually have to deal with anything, I swear.More recently, I placed an order for an expensive item to be delivered. The very day the item was to be loaded on the delivery truck, in a city JUST 15 MINUTES AWAY FROM MY LOCATION, my status updates went from “Out for delivery”, to “You will receive updates as soon as possible”, and then “Information unavailable” with a delay slapped on it. How do you go from being out for delivery, since early in the morning, to essentially “Oops, we can’t find your package! File a claim!”And attempting to file a claim does nothing but show an error—of which UPS then tells you to take the issue to the package sender, which is what? Them passing the blame onto someone else. They sure love playing ping-pong, don’t they?There is a HUGE and constant issue with people’s items intentionally being stolen before loaded onto trucks, yet UPS has done nothing to stop this, and what’s worse, they might be the only option a seller may utilize for shipments—which ALSO sucks. It would have me believe some party, other than the obvious parcel-theives, are benefiting from the losses. There’s no other reason to keep supporting, and using, a carrier you KNOW will lose or damage things on purpose. I also find it hilarious that I haven’t yet found a way to leave/view any, more widely known about and in your face, Google reviews for this company. Must be a reason for that—yet, they are still in business with a chokehold on the market.And UPS, if you plan to respond to this review, please DO NOT suggest your site’s automated chat bot. It is USELESS. So is phoning customer service. Stop passing the blame around and start cracking down on this problem. And actually help people!! My latest package has been missing/stolen—oh excuse me, under the status “““Information unavailable”””—for THREE DAYS. You don’t just misplace something so nearby to its delivery destination to the effect it needs to be missing for three days!! That’s practically the equivalent of picking up your car keys before heading out the door, but instead of unlocking your car you eat the keys instead and go “Whoops! I seem to have lost my keys! Guess I can’t go where I’m supposed to, now!!”…Come on…",2025-01-27 20:07:51,US

1,SO FRUSTRATED BY UPS!!!,"I rarely order from a company that ships using UPS, but sometimes it is unavoidable. First of all, they give you an 11-hour window for delivery. For a package/packages that require a signature, potentially, you literally have to stay home the entire day to wait for the delivery! I was supposed to receive 2 packages yesterday, and I did stay home. The driver did not make an effort to knock on door where anyone could hear it and merely hung a ""Sorry we missed you"" tag on the door and left. I understand that the drivers are under a lot of pressure timewise; I knew a UPS driver and he said it was hell to work for UPS, but you would think that they would take the time and effort to make sure someone was not home before they hang the tag and leave. Nine times out of 10 times, the UPS service has been terrible. I have had a toilet shipped and left on my porch that it was blatantly apparent the crate had been severely damaged and upon moving the crate, you could hear of sound of broken porcelain! I have had a mirror delivered where one end of the package was completely caved in and the package was clearly marked ""Fragile - Mirror"", and driver left it. Although there have been several more bad experiences and I could go on and on about UPS horror stories,  I won't. I just wish they would try to improve on their service.",2025-01-16 23:55:59,US

Now they’re telling me they can’t deliver my check today, it’s early still and I live by the FACILITY!!! Talk to a supervisor at the facility and he was very RUDE. Not holding his workers accountable and threaten to call the police. I even offered to drive and go pick it up, because I need it today NOT TOMORROW. I have to cash my check today so I can get my Medicines seeing I'm Diabetic and have to pay some bills. I use to work for UPS and know this company has lazy employees. People pay for your services and you take advantage of hard working people. There is NO WAY I shouldn’t be able to get my package today especially after UPS made a mistake and I paid for it to be delivered today.

They messed it up every time , they have horrible customer service , horrible drivers , their whole company is just the worst honestly . They treat you like you’re the problem when it is THEM that can’t do their job right . They are always late , they never get it to my actual address , sometimes they don’t even get it to me at all! Then when you call to try to figure out what is going on they want u to jump through all kinds of hoops and so all these ridiculous things to try and make their job easier , absolutely not ! You’re getting paid ! This is the job YOU picked! Do better ! If I can , I will absolutely be doing everything I can to try and avoid ever having to use them again .",2025-01-15 18:56:15,US

1,60% of the orders with UPS go sideways,"60% of the orders with UPS go sideways. To the point that I have already asked any shippers shipping to me to use someone else. I live in canada and had a purchase from the US come my way. They shipped with UPS. First the package was to be here this past friday. Didn’t come. Then Monday by 4:30 and later got an email stating that it would be here by 10 pm. Still nothing. Then another email saying by noon on Tuesday (yesterday) and still another email yesterday saying that the delivery was attempted yet I was home and have 2 security cameras showing that no delivery was attempted at 4:19 as the email states. Now they say that they will try again today and that something about customers charge due. If there is a charge is due, let me know. I could pay on line. Let’s see what today brings. This seems to be the culture for UPS here in Canada. I have had deliveries that were sent to 2 different addresses here in Canada and in 2 different provinces and the same result. ANY purchases in future i will be requesting a different delivery service other then UPS. Absolute CRAP!!",2025-01-15 19:12:23,CA
1,worst company ever,"worst company ever.  Reading the previous reviews my issues are much the same.   Tracking information says package was loaded on Truck for delivery 11pm on the 17th and our for delivery on 1/18  by 7 pm  waited all day because I did not want the package sitting out on the step. periodic tracking all said out for delivery. 7pm came and went virtual assistant is a joke no real information just automated responses but it did say residential deliveries until 9pm  9pm came and went ,kept checking the supposed up to the minute tracking it said out for delivery tried calling but after numerous automated selections I was told the office was closed and no one to talk to.  I called the vendor of the item I purchased they had the same info saying package was out for delivery.  Finally at 10:02 when I checked tracking  it said delivery delayed new delivery date when available. No delivery on Sun Mon is a holiday so Tues at the earliest after I waited all day.  Also the supposed reason for delay is weather like sever other complaints.  Again There areno weather issues roads are all clear no precipitation it's cold can they not deliver in the cold,  I will add I have nothing but issues with UPS usually they deliver to the wrong address and it's up to me to figure  out where it is. they do not help.  Also I have had several occasions where fragile perishable items  have been mishandled and damaged.  I have never had a problem with Fed Ex or the USPS.  Enough is Enough from now on before I buy something that needs to be shipped I will ask who the shipper is and if it is UPS I will not make the purchase .. It's not worth it.",2025-01-19 07:53:03,US

1,I am extremely disappointed with UPS's…,"I am extremely disappointed with UPS's international shipping service. I entrusted UPS to deliver an important package overseas, but the experience has been nothing short of frustrating. The delivery was delayed by several days without any proper updates or clear explanation.Despite paying a premium for their service, the tracking information was inconsistent, and customer support was unhelpful and vague about the cause of the delay. I understand that international shipping can be complex, but UPS should take responsibility for ensuring timely delivery or, at the very least, provide reliable communication.What’s worse is that the delay caused significant inconvenience on my end, as the package was time-sensitive. This is unacceptable for a company that markets itself as a leader in logistics. I expected better from UPS, but unfortunately, they fell far below expectations. I will seriously reconsider using their service in the future",2025-01-25 00:02:44,US
1,Worst shipping company ever,"May God watch over the packages delivered by UPS! But even that might not help anymore… It’s horror and chaos if your package ends up with them—it’s a total nightmare. Others have already written about the problems with them, and I’ve experienced the exact same issues myself.They OPEN the packages!!! And not like customs does… Someone actually opens them, unpacks them, and doesn’t even bother to reseal them. I can only imagine that if it had been a graphics card inside, it would have mysteriously disappeared… I have no idea what their warehouse worker or courier is looking for, but the fact that all eight of my packages were opened and checked in such a sloppy way is 100% certain. I’ve ordered internationally before, even from outside the EU, but I’ve never experienced anything like this in my life.The worst part of all this is that even Amazon uses them for shipping, which completely shocked me… Every single one of my packages was broken, but of course, Amazon sent replacements. The problem is, time passes, and you actually need what you’ve purchased. Not a single package was delivered to me undamaged, and every single delivery had issues. I had to email them for every single package to ensure delivery. You get a generic notification saying they couldn’t find the recipient (I was working from home, you clueless fools—at least call the person if you don’t ring the doorbell, honk, or make your presence known at all). If you don’t email them, they won’t deliver your package! I had to send an email for each of the eight packages to get them delivered.The fact that a company like this can operate in Hungary speaks volumes about the state of the country.It’s a disaster…",2025-01-16 21:49:55,HU

1,Just End UPS,"At what point is someone just going to disband UPS as a company, because I have never seen so many low reviews for one company on Trustpilot - clearly they are the most ineffective courier service ever! I spent a total of $160 and paid a massive $70 dollars shipping for an order placed on 19/12/2024, which I have not received to date. I begged the owner of the store to stop using UPS, as they are utter garbage (widely regarded), and have had my parcel in a warehouse for 2 weeks now without moving (last scan in a UPS tracking was in a warehouse on 03/01/2025). Since 03/01/2025, UPS has stopped scanning or giving any tracking updates, so I have no idea if I will ever receive my package. Maybe some of their staff is thieving, who knows, it doesn't't make sense. I have had no response from UPS to my enquiries and requests for an update, I even joined the advanced tracking (UPS My Choice), which is the most rubbish feature, the homepage after logging in won't even load up. I don't know whois running UPS these days, but it just seems like one big scam for the money you pay. People are spending har-earned money for products from all over the world and I don't care what kind of business you are running, unless you're shady, if a customer pays $70 for shipping, it is with the implicit expectation that they will receive something for all of that money. Around the same time, I made similar orders from two other stores that use USPS (US Postal Service), and I received both orders on time, so my advice to any customers and sellers is to use USPS instead for shipping from US to UK - super reliable, full tracking, and received within 5 days of store's dispatch. I was under the impression UPS was a legit store, but I simply have nothing to back that up from recent experience, because I've received nothing for all the money spent, and no-one will respond to my messages for a resolution. It's pretty shocking, and mentally distressing, and financially destructive. So thanks UPS for stripping me of over $70 during the holiday period, a great way to go into 2025! Honestly? 1 Star is too much.",2025-01-17 12:43:07,GB

1,Not ringing doorbell!,"I was told that I had to sign for my package. The package would come between 3:30 and 6:30. I wasn't feeling well so I took a nap. From like 1 to until after 2. It was coming earlier then I thought. And sometimes they arrive late. When I have gotten up. I saw that it was an attempted delivery. I then saw on my camara that I have. The driver just got the package and went up to my front porch. Didn't see anyone and then just left. Didn't as I think wait at all. I didn't even as well hear the doorbell. I would have went right to the door hearing the doorbell. I then read that they can't ring it because of that they are in  a time limit on getting deliveries out fast. To me I think its BS BIG TIME. So what we are suppose to look out the window at every cost. BS BIG TIME once again. Of we have our own things going on. LIke I don't have kids. But what if you were busy with them. Or just in general you are busy in the middle of something and loose time. I didn't feel well and I lay down like I said. My parents weren't home they were with my brother in his car. So all in all of everything. UPS SUCKS. They don't care about their customers one bit. Only about getting the order out in a fashionable manner. IF they really cared itt would be that they ring the doorbell each time for a required signaure. On top of everything, calling them is a joke in itself too. All automated which doesn't help. They deff don't understand to finially connect you to a human. Also with everything, I went to change how I can get the package. I can't do a verified signature in advanced.

Only on the 7th of November a notification showed up when I entered the tracking page saying ""UPS is missing information needed to clear this shipment."" BULLSHIT! I gave them all the information they need, but they won't ship my parcel. They said they have tried contacting the email of the receiver, but the receiver is literally a company which does not reply to random emails from UPS. I had to contact the company which I was returning the package to so they would reply to the email from UPS. After trying to explain this situation to them and getting absolutely no reply because they are lazy and respond after 3 days, FOOTPATROL finally responded to their email and they could submit my item for clearance. After this they tried to deliver it asking for 80.25 GBP. I was never informed about any extra cost such as duty VAT and disbursement. This alone is a scam, but the fact that they did not even contact me before trying to deliver it and ask the receiver to pay for the fees is just stupid. And what even is disbursement snd why does it cost 14£? Are you this desperate to scam me that you have to add non sense fees? YOU HAVEN'T EVEN ASKED ME TO PAY FOR THE YAXES THEN YOU CHARGE ME BECAUSE YOU PAID THEM ON MY BEHALF? This shipment took over 1 month instead on 1-2 weeks and for just 20 more euros I could have chosen DHL or DPD and have it delivered in time with no extra non sense fees. I will never use UPS again because they are just a bunch of lazy scammers.",2025-01-14 14:20:21,RO

Not only did the package not arrive on time, but UPS declared it lost.  For almost a month, I had to call repeatedly, speaking to customer service representatives from various countries, including Denmark, where this entire mess began. After countless complaints and forms submitted to claim the value of my package, I never received any explanation or resolution. To my frustration, the claim form I completed multiple times seemed to lead nowhere.  Today, to my shock, I found a bill for over 500 DKK in my mailbox for this so-called ""service."" Meanwhile, my package, a notarized power of attorney document, finally arrived **nearly a month late**—long after I had missed my appointment with the notary. This cost me an additional 2500 DKK, on top of the 300 DKK I spent to create the document in the first place.  The entire experience has been unacceptable. UPS failed to deliver on its promise, caused significant financial and personal inconvenience, and then had the audacity to bill me for a service they utterly failed to provide.

I have been successfully avoiding UPS for years, and am surprised that sellers and companies still use them for delivery.Recently, I had no other option, and I really liked the item, so I decided that I will deal with UPS that one time. A big mistake - their brokers do not know how to assess duties and taxes - this I know as I am well versed in import/export laws and regulations for Canada. Anyways, they assessed the tax due erroneously, and I had to call them three different times to get them to fix it. Still, the customer support would tell me that my balance due was XX$ while their website would show the old, erroneous, and higher, balance due. Customer service ensured me that it was ok to pay the lower amount regardless of what the website says. I paid what I was told to pay, but a few month later I got a letter from a collection agency for the remainder! I was shocked. Of course, I had to pay and hope that my credit score doesn’t take a hit.

EXCUSE ME? I can understand a damaged package containing liquid, but a lost one? So basically, I can pack our product up, hand it to the UPS guy, he goes and put's it in his personal car, and when we realize it's missing they can say: too bad, we don't cover liquid...BUT IT'S MISSING!??

This prevents UPS from giving a refund for failing to deliver overnight. I would understand if there was actual weather in Louisville, but this felt made up. The actual UPS office I interacted with was fine, but I am not happy about this experience.Actually it gets worse. I then get a copy of the package upon receipt showing it was severely damaged.

I thought that maybe they've sent the conformation before actually delivering it. After waiting a while longer nothing showed up and I thought my package was just gone, so I decided to check everything one last time. Apparently the dumbass who delivered it, thought it was a good idea to leave a package with electronics in rainy weather at the door. Who in their right mind would expect that?!?

1,A Complete Disgrace: Avoid USP Parcel Deliveries at All Costs,"If I could give a negative star rating, I would. My experience with USP Parcel Deliveries has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I feel compelled to warn others about their shocking incompetence and lack of accountability.In 1981, I had the honor of winning the Berlin Marathon—a moment that remains one of the proudest achievements of my life. The trophy I received is a priceless keepsake, and when the marathon organizers asked to display it for the 2024 event, I agreed, trusting it would be handled with care. Unfortunately, USP Parcel Deliveries proved that trust was gravely misplaced.On its return journey, my trophy was severely damaged, and the handling of the matter since has been appalling. USP has taken over five months to respond to my complaint, only to pass the blame onto the shipper, claiming the packaging was inadequate. How they arrived at this conclusion without ever seeing the packaging is beyond me. When the trophy was returned to me, the packaging was more than sufficient—wrapped meticulously with bubble wrap and secured with polystyrene blocks. It took me considerable effort to unpack it myself.To make matters worse, it’s clear the package was tampered with during transit. The original packaging had been opened and resealed with different tape, and the trophy’s base was inexplicably removed. Someone had clearly attempted to dismantle and “repair” the trophy, compounding the damage.A structural engineer I consulted confirmed that, given the robustness of the packaging and the construction of the trophy, the extent of the damage could only have been caused by something severe, such as being struck by a forklift. Despite this, USP insists they bear no responsibility, refusing to provide compensation and hiding behind baseless claims about inadequate packaging.The delivery itself was another fiasco. The package, booked to arrive on a Monday, inexplicably disappeared for an entire day and was only delivered on Wednesday, with no explanation given for the delay. Throughout this ordeal, I had to chase USP for updates, which were either ignored or woefully inadequate.As someone who runs a business and regularly receives parcels without issue, this experience has been eye-opening. USP’s disregard for their customers, lack of accountability, and cavalier attitude toward priceless items are utterly unacceptable.If you are seriously considering using USP Parcel Deliveries, think again. Their service is abysmal, and their approach to resolving issues is even worse. My priceless trophy—an irreplaceable piece of my history—was entrusted to them and returned irreparably damaged. You have been warned: use this company at your own peril.",2025-01-09 17:29:28,GB

In the result, there were 2 of 3 attempts of delivery which in fact were when a courier called you one time and if you didn't answer you just got a message that they weren't able to deliver your parcel. They didn't come to the delivery address, didn't leave any delivery notice with all the necessary information, and after the second attempt, said that they wouldn't deliver it for the third time and would send your parcel to another city. After that, you should wait for more than a week until it is sent to the pickup point but they won't tell you where it is. As a result, my mum finally got her present on the 9th of January but to do that she went to another city where she was informed that her parcel was in THE OTHER city and only there she got it.UPS doesn't react to your claims and messages, you are not protected from fraud and such neglect of their responsibilities by the couriers.",2025-01-09 15:42:46,GB

They did not forward it to my country, rather chose to throw it somewhere further in Europe, possibly waiting for an assortment to my home country. It’s now almost two weeks.

1,Their website/app is the stuff of nightmares,"Garmin shipped my item on the 6th, but UPS didn’t update their tracking until the 9th when the item was basically out for delivery. Which led to me needlessly hassling Garmin, when they did nothing wrong - UPS tracking just wasn’t workingThen, the driver literally gets to within two miles of my house, before he posts a message that an address has not been supplied, so he can’t deliver. Spoke to Garmin and they did supply a full address. So this is undoubtedly UPS supply chain software failing for the second time.Then I login to their website to try and update the delivery details myself, or reroute it to a UPS pickup shop. But it won’t let me update the delivery details unless I first subscribe to a different, upgraded subscription, which takes me to a new site . Then I find out that the authentication between the two UPS sites isn’t working - one site thinks I’m already a member (so can’t register again) and the other site thinks I’m not a member, so have to register. Meaning there’s absolutely no way for me to change my delivery details, or update my delivery in any way.Why, why why are you clowning around so much, making people jump through hoops to do very basic things like update delivery information? Why am I having to take out several subscriptions to do such basic things. And now you’ve made it so complicated that it doesn’t work.

1,UPS failed to deliver to contract,"UPS failed to deliver a very small packet from the UK to Germany next day by 0900 on their ""International Express Plus"" service on 19th December. Their website didn't work on 17th December to book a next day collection so I called for help. They gave me a collection code and said the driver would pick up by 3pm on the18th and that I had to pay the driver £56 in cash and that the driver would have all the forms I required to complete on the truck. I had to chase them at 2pm as no driver had shown up but he did arrive at 2.30pm. He only had Waybills on his truck, no Invoice forms for international EU delivery. I Had to find and print the forms after contacting UPS.The packet was collected at 2.45pm. On the 19th after the GUARANTEED delivery time the UPS tracker  showed the item was still in a warehouse near Stansted Airport since 10pm the previous night. I phoned and asked why it was still in the UK? The advisor said ""they had not entered the data on the system"" so it was awaiting despatch to Germany. I raised a complaint and asked for a full refund. On 31st December they emailed me to say the item was delivered on the 23rd ...3 days after the guaranteed delivery time. They said they couldn't pay a refund until they ""completed an investigation"".  On 7th January they emailed me again claiming they were still investigating.....but they didn't say what they were investigating!! There is of course nothing to investigate. They had failed to deliver to contract. I can see that there are multiple failures on UPS's part including clueless or poorly trained advisors with limited IT system access, a website that doesnt work, failure to action their processes and that they weren't even aware that the the item had been delivered on the 23rd as at  31st December.  Now some 3 weeks after the delivery date they appear to be hoping to blame the customer for their multiple failures and breach of their own contract terms. My item was time critical and that's why I paid for this premium  service. Their failure to deliver on their promise has had serious personal consequences for me. And now they are stalling the  refund. I have lost all faith in UPS. My advice is to think twice about taking a UPS service. And don't trust anyone in UPS. I hope the UPS CEO reads this honest review and sorts out the company training and customer service. And refunds me failing to deliver on the contracted service.",2025-01-07 23:07:15,GB
1,"Horrible, they expect me, with special needs, to walk through bad circumstances due to cold weather to get my package.","The UPS driver failed to deliver my package at the side of my apartment door in my building. Instead, they put it in the Management office, in my apartment complex! I'm special needs and I can't always make it there, I have to walk around the apartment complex to reach the Management office since I can't use the multiple stairs, but in cold weather when there is ice, I can't make it there at all since I don't want to get hurt trying to walk avoiding the ice. Again, I'm  special needs! I can't walk there on ice and I can't drive! It takes me a bit to get there when I can't walk on the multiple stairs around the complex! I call UPS customer service and all the foreign accented woman told me is to go to the office to get it there since it's delivered there, regardless of me unable to make it to the office. They said that there are special rules for the building which is why the driver put it there and my apartment door, then why were they able to deliver my mom's big package to my door months ago?! I see many people get packages delivered outside of the Management office as well, so there isn't really a ""rule"" in my apartment complex.Now my mom has to go and get the package from Management after work since I can't get there myself. I think these carriers are just lazy and if they feel like actually delivering a package outside of the Management office they'll do so, again if they feel like it. They don't care if you have mobility issues or are special needs. They don't care if I have a possibility of getting hurt on ice in cold weather. Customer service is inconsiderate and the drivers are lazy and also inconsiderate.",2025-01-07 20:35:58,US

Jose tried to assist was more responsive I give him that but you guessed it he couldn't help. He gave me a UK number to call he got my hopes up but not for long after yet more auto services I got through to the customs duty department great i was on the right track but no he didn't understand english and transfered me to someone else who didn't speak or understand english, I was transfered to an automated system again and non of the options where for customs or complaints. I hung in there and eventually someone answered again poor grasp of the english language her solution was to take my email address I had to repeat myself 18 times and now left praying she eventually got it correct and I will get a reply from the correct department.

The other night I was able to view my delivery truck which was in the next neighborhood when suddenly I was postponed until the next day for no reason.

It's the 4th and there website still says it will be there on the 6th.  I called again and they could give no reason why it won't get there until the 6th.

I paid and still called the customer service and got them on second day of trying just to get them tell me I have to pay for the cost of delivery since 3 attempts were made. Agreed to pay and noticed they have no secure line and call is recorded and still they insisted to get my card details (card number, security code, expiry date) which I declined and was directed to do it online, but the option to redirect was not available to do so.

After I'd recovered from that heart attack I thought I'd check if it was the same from the UK to my address. It was $45. Now I'm no mathematician but if tge parcel is the same weight, dimension and travelling the sane distance, you'd assume tge price would be relevant. UK customs are only 20%, for the value of that to be worthwhile, the value of the contents would need to be $1566 (assuming UPS are footing the customs bill, which they aren't).

1,I would give them less than one star if…,"I would give them less than one star if possible. Every facet of their operation is a master class in how to provide poor customer service. They never leave any information when they leave a sticker on your door for a failed delivery attempt. Getting a hold of a human being at UPS is nearly a possible and when you do, it’s usually somebody with a significant language barrier That cannot provide any information except what’s on the screen. They even realize how bad their customer service is because their website even tells you that the limited and usually incorrect information on the tracking status is exactly what the live representatives have access to. It’s like they’re admitting how ignorant their system is. Any company that ships using UPS does a disservice to the reputation of their own company. It’s taken me over a week to sort out just simply receiving a package from Apple sent by UPS. That’s basically been circling my neighborhood for five days because of the incompetence of UPS. It’s completely reasonable that their corporate colors are brown because what an absolute shit show.",2025-01-02 22:16:49,US

The $30 I felt was a high fee BUT I paid it because of the speed of delivery. NOW my family member in Germany just got a notice that “package is delayed until January 11th”. I would have never paid $30 to UPS in Rome Italy if I knew it would take TWO WEEKS to go from Rome to southern Germany. I will refute my credit card charge of $30. I chose NOT to mail via the Rome post office with a much cheaper fee because I felt it would take longer delivery time then I was willing to accept SO I chose UPS.

Additionally, support page and number was hard to reach, phone call options are choosen with voice rather than number, and the machine keeps saying it does not understand and to repeat, you can imagine giving that for the tracking number..

1,Another package lost by UPS,"Another package lost by UPS.  I'm sorry, but the backlog should be well on its way to being cleared by now and the weather had nothing to do with the shipment being lost.  I will no longer do business with a company that ships via UPS.  I'm done with their chatbots and customer service reps that read from a script.  I'm editing this post to add that another package has been lost by UPS...this is the third package in the last two weeks.  How do they stay in business with such poor service?",2025-01-03 15:29:56,CA

Their delivery guy was leaving my pkg out in the open at the wrong door in the pouring rain where any theif going by could clearly see its a microwave...ran out and yelled as if your going to leave that there in the pouring rain to be stolen! So he proceeds to lie to my face and say ""oh no mam I do safe delivery always"" even after I told him repeatedly I seen him on my security camera leaving it on the wet ground walking away taking his picture for proof of delivery still lied to my face!

1,Extremely Disappointed,"I am extremely disappointed with both Temu and UPS. I placed an order weeks ago, and despite Temu claiming it was delivered, I have not received it. My door camera shows no evidence of any delivery attempt. To make matters worse, UPS has conflicting dates in their system for when they allegedly delivered the package, which only adds to the dishonesty and confusion. I have contacted Temu’s customer support multiple times, but they have been unhelpful and dismissive, failing to take responsibility or provide any real solutions. UPS has also failed to provide clear or accurate information about the delivery. This lack of accountability and transparency from both companies is completely unacceptable. This experience has been incredibly frustrating, I strongly urge others to reconsider using Temu or trusting UPS, as their delivery process and customer service have proven to be unreliable and untrustworthy.",2024-12-26 20:30:04,ZA

1,Worst,"I can't say that my review is completely objective, as I have only used this company's services once, but that was enough for me to understand that this is a terrible delivery service.  Previously, I thought Canada Post was the worst, but unfortunately, when they were on strike, the store where I purchased my item decided to ship the package via UPS.  Overall, I've been waiting for my package for about 10 days now, even though an approximate delivery date was set three days ago.  However, they kept delaying and eventually blamed the situation on an emergency or bad weather, and they completely removed the estimated delivery date.  In my opinion, this is the worst delivery service in Canada, even compared to Canada Post.",2024-12-26 10:26:47,CA

Worst of all, because of this and whatever the reasons, the customer service said the delivery is delayed till Monday(obviously it didnt arrived). I contact customer service again and they keep saying wait and package will be delivered today. I checked today and it said it is delayed because of Christmas break. How long do I have to wait for this “express” delivery when everything has been verified and confirmed yet no delivery whatsoever?",2024-12-24 20:56:54,VN
2,Cost-better customer service-Think,"I frequent this UPS all the time, the customer service from the young ladies and gentlemen are very exceptional. Unfortunately I was not served by one of them on the date I went in, it was their operations manage this time. He was not customer friendly as I expected him, to be for the busieness I was giving the company. He went over the cost of shipping my holiday packages, and I felt like he was only concerned about what he could charge me for the company. It is very imporant for us as customers to read the confirm section they ask us to review, because I was charged a fee, it was not much for a donation to the Junior Achievement, which was on my receipt. Because I did not read the confirmation before I excepted it I was not aware of the charge. I feel like that should be mentioned to us as customers, even with the holiday season, we are all in a hurry, and if your like me , I don't like to hold people up in lines at any time. So I feel like I was taken advangtage of by this gentleman. His service with me a truly put a damper on UPS at this location I have frequent.

1,UPS offers a very SUBPAR service,"I was scheduled to receive a xmas gift I had purchased abroad. UPS apparently tried to deliver it twice and failed, but never notified me. I was at home during those delivery attempts.After a last delivery attempt, they sent me an email communication stating that the package is on its way back to the sender in a different country. Called customer support to ask why I did not receive any calls if my phone number is given as part of the delivery address. The answer is that 'drivers are not required to use their personal phones to call recipients'.It is also impossible to give feedback to them, as the only way to file a complaint is if they lose the package, or it arrives damaged.All in all, very subpar. Delivery attempts were failed because the intercom in my building was not working during those days. Other delivery companies kindly reached out to my phone and we could meet at the entrance of the building for me to pick up my parcels.UPS did not try to contact me, even it is obvious the intercom doesn't work. Neither they sent me any notification until the last delivery attempt when it was too late. Their mobile app and website also don't work properly and while trying to sort it out online all I got was technical error messages. Awful. Avoid them as much as you can, or be on top of them constantly for your parcels. Worst logistics in Spain.",2024-12-24 12:14:08,CH

UPS showed up today December 23rd at 7:24pm. I didn't hear them so they left a note in the door. I immediately called the number it had on there. I spoke with PATRICK COKER. and explained the situation. He told me to text him my address. He got in touch with the driver BRADFORD MOORE. The driver turned around and came back. I use to work for UPS years ago so I know how hectic this time of year is for UPS. So I want to give them 5 stars for their excellent service for going above and beyond.

5,Above and Beyond,"I want to take a moment to recognize the outstanding service provided by Michael Dobbs, a UPS delivery driver in my area. Michael has consistently demonstrated superb customer service and an exceptional work ethic, going above and beyond to ensure that deliveries are handled with care and professionalism.On one occasion, he delivered a couch to my back garage. When I stepped out to open the garage and retrieve my dolly, Michael returned from his truck and kindly offered to assist. Without hesitation, he lifted and slid the box into my home—a gesture that saved me considerable effort and demonstrated his attentiveness and willingness to go the extra mile.Another time, he delivered a very large box to my front door and lifted it into the doorway for me. This act may have seemed minor to him, but it was incredibly significant for me, as I have a condition that affects my legs, despite my youthful appearance. His kindness and consideration truly made a difference.In today’s world, it’s all too common for customers to focus on poor service, but I wanted to take the time to highlight Michael's exceptional service, pleasant demeanor, and hard work. His efforts are a testament to what great customer service looks like—especially in a climate where even basic courtesy can sometimes feel rare.I hope UPS management sees this review and ensures that Michael’s dedication and hard work do not go unnoticed. He is a shining example of the kind of employee who elevates the reputation of the company and leaves a positive impact on customers like me. Thank you, Michael, for your kindness and professionalism—it’s truly appreciated.Tahirah Sumbry",2024-12-22 01:01:22,US

They told me to wait for an email. There's never been an email, but when I call their corporate office. The package was delivered at 1:43 PM. And I went there at 4 PM the same day. Their excuse at the store was they don't have enough help. Then they said, well, we don't scan everything in. I said, well, that's funny. 'cause your corporate office scanned it in and knew it was there. Now I have to drive back to get It on the Weekend.

I paid for express on top of that due to the level of urgency it was to receive ON TIME! I waited all day & at the last minute received notification of incomplete address due to missing apt # so after 3 hours on the phone and no tears left in me I was told it was updated but unfortunately I wouldn’t receive until today. I check my tracking today and it say returning to sender due to INCOMPLETE ADDRESS!!!! I call them speak to numerous managers and was told it was escalated and addressed changed but THEN TOLD THEY COULD NOT LOCATE MY PACKAGE YET AT THE FACILITY. Manger told me it was flagged and when scanned it they would update it and get it out to me! Well here I am now on the phone because I called back and the guy says they are returning to sender and NO ONE EVER PUT MY APT # to correct my address. I missed a funeral due to no $ to travel because I needed my card to come so I can go. I’m hurt and feel like I’ll  never get this solved and no one cares really if I get it or not because it’s just a job to them. I don’t know what else to do to get someone to just take the time and do the job hired to do. Take the time to help really correct someone’s issue when they call. Don’t rush me off to he phone and provide me incorrect information and no effort to correct it or find out how. Over all over spent over 8 hrs communicating with UPS for me to have NOTHING TO SHOW. I need HELP! I need someone to care enough to HELP ME WITH THIS! This is my livelyhood. Someone please tell me what I can do to get the help I need PLEASE,2024-12-21 03:29:02,US

I checked the weather from Dallas to Los Angeles and it is clear.  I have had numerous packages delayed to one thing or another.

Our package was processed MONDAY and I am writing this on FRIDAY still without our cards (supposed to have left this morning). UPS swore they tried to deliver our package Wednesday and Thursday but were unable. We live in an apartment building where you have to ring to get in. No one rang and not only that we have a concierge in the lobby who receives our packages… nothing, AND I was home all day both days…nothing. We call about 15 times to solve the problem and say we will go and pick it up ourselves at shipment center. Multiple customer service agents say they will call and tell them to leave it there so we can pick it up. IT STILL WENT ON THE TRUCK. We’re calling again this morning to ask them to contact the driver to drop it off at their closest location so we can pick it up and leave for our vacation. After multiple phone calls with the most incapable people I’ve ever dealt with in my life they say they are unable to contact the driver and the package will be delivered sometime before 9pm (or we hope because apparently the two other times the driver couldn’t bring themselves to ring our apartment and walk into the lobby).

I filed a claim that was supposedly investigated by a UPS investigator, and the claim was then approved. I got an email saying g the check would be sent in 5 days then I got an email saying the claim had been voided because the coins had a high value. WTF??? They stole my coins and are now screwing me out of the insurance claim! Unbelieveable!",2024-12-17 23:41:42,US

1,Taking advantage of people during the holidays and during a strike,"I went to the UPS store in Denman Mall here in Vancouver. We’ve had  a federal postal strike in Canada and I really needed to mail off an important document to my Union. I’ve bern to this store before for computer, fax and express mail stuff before. I knew they were a bit pricey, but my experience tonight was ridiculous. There was one guy working and about 8 people wanting service. The store was a mess with boxes littered all across the floor. People couldn’t move in there and were bumping into each other. The one worker was over whelmed and kept apologizing. He was very disorganized as we all were waiting to mail off letters and send gifts with their mail service. I had to grab a pen behind his desk because he was busy helping someone else. I filled out my envelope and when it was my turn he told me I needed to fill out another form…he did this with everyone which I thought was a waste of time when UPS could have had those forms and pens  out and excesible for all people to fill out while he was busy with other customers. Finally, after a 25 min wait I got up to the workers desk again and I asked him how much it would cost to mail off a single page letter locally to my Union her in Vancouver. I aLeo asked him what my options were? He told me there was only one option to send it express and it would cost me $35 plus tax. I was shocked! The woman before sent out a whole box filled with gifts for $75 and she was sending it to a different province, For a one page letter I was expecting $10 maybe $15 it was a single page letter and being delivered locally. There was no way I was paying that! I remember thinking is UPS using the postal strike and Christmas to rip people off? Also none of their prices weee listed in a price board, I found the store to be extremely disorganized, short staffed for the Christmas season, unprofessional staff, messy interior, no pens or execible  forms to fill out and they wasted my time. I even shared this with the one worker there, but he didn’t seem genuinely sincere and he just kept apologizing almost as a way to get ride if me. Anyways will not be going back….$35 for 1 letter…I can’t get over it! What a joke and ripping people off.  Very upset!",2024-12-17 15:47:29,CA

As I write this review, we are still waiting for those parcels, which is unacceptable for an express service.

Just received this reply, shockingly bad grammar!“At the outset, allow me the opportunity to apologize for the late response and for any inconvenience this situation has caused you. This is not the experience we would like you to have. As per checking here on my end, the shipper has created a new shipping label to shipped your package since the package came from the US going to UK and the shipment new shipment label has been created, therefore, there is an import charges that has been billed to the package.

They need to update their tracking system to be able to see exactly where your item is at all times like others do. Even Canada Post has a better tracking system when they aren't on strike. On day 2 of 'being delivered today' and it not showing up. You would think if they run out of time to deliver it the first day they would put the packages missed at the top of the schedule for the next day.UPDATE: my parcel arrived smelling of cigarette smoke.",2024-12-18 15:28:38,CA
1,UPS - Frustrating Tracking and Limited Delivery Control,"UPS.com is hands down the worst website. Anytime I ordered something online and they send me tracking info and I see it is coming vis UPS. I'm incredibly disappointed with UPS's online service. Here are two major issues that have made my recent experiences incredibly frustrating:1. Inaccurate and Unreliable Tracking:Out of date information: UPS tracking updates are often sluggish and inaccurate. It's incredibly frustrating to see the same scan message for days, leaving me completely in the dark about the whereabouts of my package.No explanation for delays: Tracking rarely offers any explanation for delays. Is it stuck at a facility? Is there a delivery issue? I'm left guessing and worrying.2. Non-functional ""Change My Delivery"" Option:Useless feature: The ""Change My Delivery"" option on the UPS website seems like a great idea, but it simply doesn't work. I've tried to redirect packages to a pick-up location or hold them at a facility, but the system never processes the request. It often redirects me to keep signing-in. Forced to rely on customer service via their chat feature: That's a negative review in itself...Overall, UPS's online tracking and delivery management system feels outdated and unreliable. It leaves me feeling frustrated and powerless when it comes to my packages. Until these issues are resolved, I'll be hesitant to use UPS or recommend them to others.",2024-12-16 17:52:53,US

1,From a pro CDL delivery driver send…,"From a pro CDL delivery driver send this to your corporate customer service. Second thought. I’ll do it for you. “UPS Delivery Discrepancy: A Problem on Their EndA delivery discrepancy with UPS has highlighted an issue on their end, not mine as the consignee. As the recipient of the goods, my role is clearly defined: to receive and take ownership of the shipment once it has cleared the necessary steps, such as customs, and any required import duties or taxes have been addressed. However, the current situation reveals that the breakdown is within UPS’s handling of the transportation process.To clarify, the consignee is only responsible for being present to collect the shipment unless alternative arrangements have been made. Yet UPS’s role as the carrier includes ensuring the accurate delivery of goods to the consignee. Any failure to deliver properly or to resolve a discrepancy falls squarely on UPS, not the consignee. Ownership of the goods is transferred only after full payment to the consignor, which means UPS’s responsibility lies in fulfilling the agreed transportation terms—not shifting blame onto the recipient.Additionally, UPS must recognize their role in the logistics chain alongside the consignor and consignee. Whether this involves ensuring proper tracking, documentation, or communication, these are responsibilities they are obligated to fulfill. Delays, miscommunications, or errors in handling goods cannot be attributed to the consignee, as the consignee is merely the recipient of the goods, not the cause of transportation or logistical errors.The issue at hand demonstrates a mismanagement on UPS’s part, and any resolution needs to be addressed by their team. They are the designated carrier, responsible for ensuring that the shipment is delivered correctly to the intended recipient. The consignee’s legal role does not include remedying errors caused by the carrier, meaning UPS must resolve this discrepancy promptly and professionally.”",2024-12-14 20:02:00,US

ALL LIES. At the end, the parcel was lost, and they lost my time chasing for more than 2 weeks. Their customer support are so bad, at the end they were putting me for hours on hold.

To top it off I spoke with 2 different people who had very heavy accents and between their accent and the background noise it was very, very difficult to understand what they were saying to me.  I would suggest calling the vendor(s) you bought from and encourage them to use a different delivery service - that's what I'm going to do because if I order from now on and they say it will be delivered by UPS I'll tell them to cancel the order.

I recieve notice of a change in status, it will now be delivered on the 10th. between 1215-1615. I cancel an appointment to be home. A little later I notice additionel info that the package is delayed one day. That is mixed signals? So I call customer service. It will now be delivered on the 11th. is the message. But why then send me a status update when it was already the information I had recieved earlier?Today on the 11th. the supposed day of delivery (between 1215-1615 remember!), I take my mother to the hospital for a check-up. While there I recieve a new message from UPS, time of delivery is now still the 11th., but between 1420-1620. What I only realize later is that UPS tried to deliver the package at 11.06! I was home from the hospital at 11.45, ready in the allocated time slot YOU told me it would be delivered!So I once again call customer support and the message is ""too bad"", you were not home so it will be delivered the next day or you can pick it up. Standard shipping for some reason gives UPS the right to deliver all day.....but why then send me a time interval at all?When I talk to customer service (what a joke name), no manager has the guts to talk to me. When I check trustpilot.dk, many people have had the same problems and it is now no longer possible to write a review because you have shut down your webpage in Denmark.Your service is terrible and I will never choose UPS willingly again. I have also written to the company who sent me my package, advicing them to not use UPS.You are holding your customers packages hostage, with no real posibility to complain or actually recieve proper service. It is a disgrace and I would advice you to go over your messaging system and actually deliver in the delivery ""window"" you youself inform your customers about, as a bare minimum, to minimize customer frustration in the future. It is also really unfair towards your customer representatives as they get all the ""heat""Today I spoke to Jon and Oskar, and it is not fair that they have to listen to me shouting on the phone because no one higher up has the guts to speak with an actual customer.I am still fuming by the lack of basic service from UPS....",2024-12-11 19:38:18,DK

I called the main office to ask why they lied about the “ severe weather conditions “ and they still tried to claim that was the reason until I said no I live in Alberta and yesterday was a beautiful day. No severe weather conditions AT ALL . Why lie? Why is this company so mishandled. So corrupt?

Despite filing a claim, I have not received any updates or resolution on this matter. To assist with the investigation, I have attached an image of the lost luggage to this email. My humble request is for UPS to restart the investigation using the provided image and locate my bag. The luggage holds significant personal value to me, and I am not seeking reimbursement or compensation-simply want the bag returned to me at the address on file. I acknowledge my oversight in not purchasing insurance for this item, but I sincerely hope UPS can help me retrieve it this time. I assure you that I will take necessary precautions in the future, but I kindly ask for your understanding and assistance in this instance. This is my final attempt to directly reach out for help. Please ensure this email is forwarded to the appropriate team or investigation officer who can address this matter promptly. Your help in locating my bag would mean the world to me.

So if you miss a shipment and they notify you in the evening, you can't even do shit. Your best chance is to get it 2 days later.

I choose the email option, and then pick from the selection. I went with “I want my package delivered without signature”. Lo and behold it brings me to “error: your request can’t be completed at this time”. The last time I “missed” my delivery, even though the driver just decided not to bother delivering the package, I had to go on a wild goose chase to find it, costing me nearly a full day and a bunch of money in gas, let alone the frustration.

Staples was kind enough to add “fragile” stickers to the box that was over $114 to ship. The packages I shipped arrived at my home in another state and the package that had the extra insurance with all the fragile stickers looked as if it was deliberately dropped from a 10 story building. Arrived broken was a very well bubble wrapped 100+ year old brass wall clock. The solid brass around this clock was so crushed that the mishandling of this package had to be deliberate. The day the packaged arrived I tried to file a claim with UPS. I was almost done with the claim (which was no easy chore) when I was asked for my account number. After spending 45 minutes opening an account and filling out all the questions there was no account number anywhere. I did google “where is the account number was when making a claim with UPS” and the answer given still provided me with no account number. I gave up.

1,UPS officially worst delivery company in the UK,"For years, Hermes (now Evri) were, in my opinion, the worst delivery company in the country. I would say that UPS have now usurped them. Here's why:I placed an online order with a company called Rugvista on 29th November. Delivery was supposed to be made within 1-5 working days.On Weds 4th Dec I received an email from UPS stating my item would be delivered by end of the day. However there seemed to some sort of delay at customs at Stanford Le Hope so the delivery did not happen. I received another email on Thurs 5th Dec stating the item was ""on it's way"" from Northampton. I live in Peterborough.I took a second day off work waiting for the parcel to arrive. The website did not show any updates and the item still has not arrived. By Friday 6th Dec, the UPS website still shows the item as ""on it's way"" from Northampton and had not updated since Thursday morning. Having already taken 3 days off from work at this point, I could not afford to miss a 4th waiting for the item to arrive and sign for it so I called UPS customer service on 0345 787 7877 (A little tip, when it comes to the spoken options say ""speak to someone"" and you will eventually get through to an actual person). That being said, the customer service person I spoke to was completely ineffectual and useless. After explaining to her the emails I had received and lack of tracking updates on the website after looking into it all she did was confirm to me the exact details I had given her.A scant explanation was given that ""this is the busy period"" hence the delays. But, in my opinion, all delivery companies should know this is the beginning of the busy period of the year and do whatever they can to minimise delays like this from happening.Also, apparently the emails are part of an automated system. She did offer me the option of going to the Northampton depot and collecting the item myself (so, instead of the DELIVERY COMPANY doing their job and delivering my item on time they give me the option of collecting it from them).The customer service person did take down my number and said they would contact the depot and have someone call me before end of business. Obviously that call didn't happen. I was also told just to keep checking the website for updates and if it hasn't updated over the weekend, to call them back so they can look into it again.Saturday morning I wake up and check the website to see it has finally updated and the item is ""out for delivery"" and should arrive between 2pm - 6pm. As it was 11am I thought I had plenty of time to head down to my local garage to pick up my motorcycle that had been in for repairs. Halfway through my journey I get an alert from the cctv camera at my house. UPS have arrived almost 3 hours early!!!So after days of delays on an item that needs to be signed for they give me a time window and then arrive early. Fortunately I had a friend staying over who was able to accept and sign for it.I will NEVER use UPS for anything. And if any company I order things from online use UPS I shall contact the company directly to arrange for a different delivery company to be used or go and find the item elsewhere from someone that does not use UPS.

Today I spent all morning trying to trace a piece of electronic equipment which was sent to me from Germany and which originally was going to arrive on 5 December. 2 days later, the online information named 10 December as the new delivery date. The following day they said it would be 7 December. I had to rearrange all my appointments and arrangements and waited all morning for the allotted time to arrive. At this particular point in time I received a message to say that they tried to deliver, but there was nobody at home. An absolute utter lie, as both my husband and I were here all morning waiting for the delivery.

I then waited for over 1 half hour for the supervisor and a recording came on and told me there is a 1 hour wait time.

On Thursday, the same thing happened, with repeated changes and delays.On Friday, I was notified that my parcel would be delivered between 9-11 AM. I waited all day and had to call customer service multiple times. I was told it would ""definitely"" arrive by 6 PM, then by 7 PM, but it never arrived. By 9 PM, it was clear there would be no delivery at all.This lack of accuracy and reliability has caused me significant inconvenience. This parcel was time-sensitive and needed to be sent to another country. Due to these delays, it is now impossible for me to send it, resulting in a considerable loss.I expect a professional delivery service to provide clear and accurate updates, and to deliver on promises made.

Whatever you purchased  to improve your life, it is now a constant reminder that life sucks. You will never enjoy that thing you bought - UPS have rendered it worthless but tuning it into an instrument of frustration and pain.If a merchant uses UPS - save yourself the effort and misery and shop elsewhere, or alternatively walk to the shop yourself - even if that retailer is international you will still save time, money and frustration by walking there yourself instead  - at least that would be an adventure.",2024-12-06 21:10:56,GB
1,UPS is the absolute worst courier service on the planet.,"UPS is the absolute worst courier service on the planet. I have deliveries weekly, sometimes even daily to my office. Depending on the driver, so many will refuse to deliver for the absolute dumbest reasons. I could actually list 100 incidences of this, but just in the last week there has already been 2. I have had to call UPS four times in the last week, because one of the packages they apparently tried to deliver at 9pm at night when our office was closed (shocker!) And then put on the tracking that they refuse to deliver now because apparently my address of almost 20 years doesn't exist...Then another package a couple days later they didn't even attempt delivery, just marked it as a ""failure attempt"" because again, apparently they think my address is made up fictional place. Nope. It's a real place!Of course customer service was very little help, because when I finally got through and gave them the ""correct"" addresses that they apparently needed, they were the same ones that were already on the packages. So through this last 2 weeks I have had to call several times because one of them then ended up in Saskatoon.. (WTF) and the other one got delivered to a totally different business. A hardware store 5 km away (Again, WTF!)It's come to a point that if I know ahead of time that UPS will could be the courier for one of my deliveries, I find any way possible to not use them. I would urge anyone else to so the same. I would even choose Canada post everytime over UPS (Yeesh) and even with the current strike, we will probably still get my deliveries sooner than with UPS.At least then I also wouldn't have to call customer service weekly and waste my breath trying to convince them my address is real, not some fictious made up place that they keep refusing to deliver to.",2024-12-06 20:43:49,CA

The only reason I'm leaving this review here and not on Yelp is that I don't want to penalize a physical location and its employees for the company's mistakes. 3 more bugs in 10 days have earned UPS this review:1) online seller had guaranteed room-of-choice delivery (heavy items). UPS just deposited them at the lobby. We had to lug them to our apartment.2) impossible to create an account: bugged at the address ZIP code (which I've been using for many years). Had to call 3 times, get disconnected, call back through a pretty long and complicated system to find help. In the end it did work but it took me approx. 1 hour to create a simple account (?!?!?!)3) my significant other bought an item through Best Buy and all of a sudden we receive an SMS notification that delivery will be made to the ""UPS Access Point"". We called UPS to confirm that the (heavy) parcel will be coming to our home and not some Access Point, they reassure us and on the day of delivery we receive a vague notification that the parcel is on its way as requested. Seemed fishy so I called UPS once again. After >1h on the phone with UPS we discovered that indeed our package was headed not towards our home but to that Access Point (which we had never selected), we cancelled, they rescheduled for our home but with 4 days delay. We are understanding people but recurrent mistakes, with (literally) heavy consequences for us, in both time and resources, are a red flag.From now on, we will try to avoid online sellers that use UPS as I don't see any other way to make even the slightest impact on this faceless, inhumane system.Oh, and talking about faceless, their Virtual Assistant (like in many other services eg. health insurance, other carriers) is so useless, waste-of-time, nerve-wracking and patience-trying that it almost comes across as ironic!",2024-12-05 16:48:58,US

Since then I have signed up for a UPS My Choice account, attempted to interact with that website and have spoken with two different customer service representatives. I am now enraged, frustrated and don’t understand how they are still a viable company.I have two packages coming via UPS. On the UPS tracking page for one item, I saw there were Change My Delivery options, which I wanted to access. A pop up said I needed to enroll in UPS My Choice to do so, so I did and then logged in. While LOGGED IN TO MY CHOICE, all attempts to view Change My Delivery options gave me a pop-up window saying I should enroll for My Choice. I tried again and again with the same result.I called customer service to try to figure out why their site didn’t work. After many irrelevant questions, I was finally told that my My Choice account and my package weren’t linked. Again, I enrolled in My Choice from the link ON THE ITEM TRACKING PAGE. After more frustration, wasted time and running in circles, I said I just wanted to delete my My Choice account because it was inoperable. I was transferred.The next representative asked for my item tracking number. I explained that I wasn’t calling about a package, but wanted to delete my My Choice account. She asked for my tracking number. I explained that I was told my item tracking number and my My Choice account weren’t linked, and I was calling about my My Choice account. She asked for my tracking number. I gave up and gave her the tracking number. She made me repeat it, she repeated it and then said that wasn’t a valid number. I read it again. She interrupted me so I had to start over. She repeated it. She said it wasn’t a valid number. She said I should contact the shipper for the correct number. I explained I was reading the UPS tracking number from the UPS item tracking page on the UPS website. She made me read the number again. We did this a few more times with the exact same number we’d been passing back and forth, but eventually it seemed to be a valid number. “What would you like to do with this package?” she asked me. I counted to ten. I explained the purpose of my call yet again. She asked my username, my email, my address and made me repeat each several times. She said I had the email address wrong. It couldn’t have been, but I finally gave her every email address I’ve ever owned. Eventually she seemed satisfied with one or all of those. She said the address was wrong. I gave her both addresses UPS had for me but she said both were wrong.My Choice is inaccessible, even when you’re logged in. I spent 40 minutes on the phone trying to cancel my My Choice account and was unable to do so because their extreme disorganization, lack of training and wild incompetence beat my intelligence and determination. I hung up and called back thinking there must be SOMEONE there with two brain cells to rub together, and the same woman answered. I am beaten.

Adding to this, they refused provision of leaving it at a facility where i could pick it up with my ID. When i called them to inquire where the item is, they told me now i can pick it up from the sorting facility nearby, which was contrary to what they were telling me before. When i asked them where this sorting facility was they gave me an address that was in Winnipeg, Manitoba while I live in Vancouver, BC. I could not make the agent understand that in 3 hours, the driver would have managed to leave the parcel at their nearest facility (which i googled research and told them) instead of flying 3 hours to 3000 km east.

After a week of wondering where my package was I did a trace and found out the package was dropped off to the UPS office in Orillia with no attempt at delivery.  The reason?  Couldn't get it here by their promised delivery date.  When I asked if I could get it delivered they said I had to call UPS Canada to set it up.  They are counting on this and they do not deliver the package correctly.  Would not recommend this mode of delivery on any level.,2024-12-04 17:01:19,CA

I directly go in to change the delivery to pickup, as I don’t want to sit at home and wait for a package to arrive, wasting my time and not knowing when it arrives. Tried 4 times, both on mobile and PC – get an error when I try to complete it with some numbercode and ”contact support. 3.

Get an answer from UPS support, early thursday – they change it to pickup point, it will arrive there by the end of the day and I can pick it up tomorow (Friday). Great, problem solved. 6. No package arrives on Friday, no message. 7. Contact UPS support over weekend and say ”hey I never got my package on Friday as you said I would.. ” 8. Get answer on Monday that, package hasn’t been scanned since Thursday so something must be wrong and that I should ”file a claim”, respond back ”not scanned since Thursday, meaning what?

1,Subject Disappointing Delivery Experience,"Dear UPS Customer Service,I am writing to express my frustration with the poor delivery service I have experienced regarding my recent purchase from Emma Sleep.After placing my order with Emma Sleep, I was not given the option to select a delivery date, which isn't really your fault. Instead, I only became aware of the schedule through an email from UPS. I promptly requested delivery for Saturday, November 30th, but no delivery occurred on that date, nor did I receive any updates from UPS.Upon contacting UPS yesterday, I discovered there was missing information from Emma Sleep regarding my delivery, including full name, address, and phone number. This lapse in communication is unacceptable and has caused a significant delay.Additionally, I was informed there were two separate deliveries—one for a mattress and another for a pillow. Initially, only the pillow was out for delivery. After further discussion, I was assured both the mattress and pillow would arrive on December 3rd. Unfortunately, today's follow-up confirmed that only the pillow is scheduled, with no clarity on the mattress, adding to my frustration.This lack of coordination between UPS and Emma Sleep has resulted in a highly unsatisfactory experience. The shifting information and unfulfilled promises have been incredibly inconvenient.I request immediate clarification regarding the status of my mattress delivery and assurance of a timely resolution. I believe it is essential for UPS to improve its communication and coordination processes with partners to prevent such issues.Thank you for your attention to this matter.",2024-12-03 15:42:34,GB

On top that I have literally NO way to give them the code because every time I try to contact them it just shoots me around the website since non of the links actually work & I can’t email them without creating an account (which apparently I have done before so I can’t access it because they won’t send me an email with my username). I just don’t understand what the point of having a website is if it’s not going to work at all.

Far too late, but I tried anyways. I was told they would reroute the package and get a call in an hour. I didn't, so I call 3 hours later. I am told the same thing they will give me a call in about an hour. They didn't call. By the time the next day comes around it is still on route back to sender. At this point I have to work with the original company to send it back to me, now costing this company additional money to send it back to me, and further hassle for both of us.So, they assess my (correct) address was wrong, don't call me to verify, send it back late on a Saturday, and don't do anything to resolve the issue of the delivery person when I do call in (twice).",2024-12-02 19:29:12,US

When I contacted UPS, the response was dismissive, and they insisted that the package had been delivered without offering any concrete evidence or solution. I was asked to contact the sender, but UPS failed to acknowledge their responsibility as the shipping carrier.What made this worse was the lack of follow-up.

1,UPS is incompetent,"UPS is incompetent. Order was sent out to be delivered Monday, never came. Emailed and told it would be Tuesday, it did not arrive with another package delivered by UPS. I called and was promised it would be delivered Wednesday. It's Saturday still no package. I called them again and they claim the package will be delivered Monday. Needless to say this is not the first time this has happened. UPS is by far the worst when it comes to delivering package. I wish companies would not use them. Update: Monday and no package, I was told it will be delivered tomorrow. The person I talked to just blamed UPSs software, for blocking it from going out for delivery.",2024-12-03 03:11:31,US

That UPS Colombia added 100% of the value of the goods plus their fees and demanded 560 $ US from us, otherwise they would take the package back. We refused and demanded that they check this absurd invoice as customs and fees cannot be higher than the value of the goods. We were also denied this. This was after we had been writing to UPS every day for three weeks because they never responded to our questions and instead just kept sending the same prefabricated answers. Quite terrible customer service. We have now requested that they return the package to the sender. Now they not only want money for it but also a letter of law... We are so annoyed. Never again UPS, never in my life. The worst delivery service with the worst customer service. Period.Just adding to the story. Instead of sending back to Germany, they've sent it to Kansas City!!!

1,Baffles me why anyone uses them,"Why any company who cares about their customers choose to use UPS in the UK is beyond me. Every time we've expected a UPS delivery there have been problems. Just a few recent highlights:- Fake delivery attempts (saying they attempted deliveries when they didn't). Always with attempt times of 5-6PM so it's obvious the driver couldn't be bothered.- Stating delivery to the wrong places. Tracking saying they delivered our package to a random location in a different town/city and then washing their hands of the situation. The delivery address on the order is clearly totally different to the location their tracking states the package was delivered to, but nobody seems to care.- Package theft! Probably the most alarming one. High value packages going missing in UPS depots and the customer service reps admitting they have probably been stolen by sorting staff. I mean, really?I'm writing this when as a household we currently have two UPS deliveries that haven't been completed as planned. One is now nearly 2 weeks late and appears lost. The second has suffered from the fake attempts habit.They are the only mainstream courier I'm aware of that doesn't deliver on weekends. Contacting them is painful. And when you finally manage it nothing gets resolved.Please businesses of Britain, use someone else. Anyone else.",2024-11-29 10:15:05,GB

They said they would deliver today on Thursday which I am home and they're not here yet. It's already 6:10 p.m.. obviously they're not doing anything, just playing games like usual. Wow. Such a useless company. Really when you get down to it. Lucky where I buy my stuff from in Vancouver they switched over to Purolator which is 10 times faster. I guess they realized UPS was an issue for them and their customers. I have no use for UPS. Would never use them personally. Don't recommend to anybody. You probably just have one guy working there. Funny. It says second attempt not successful. I wonder why. I was here all day, watching both my monitors on my outside cameras and no one showed up. Don't know what's going on with these guys but there's something incredibly wrong with this company seriously. Maybe they need to go out of business or something because they must be pissing a lot of people off during this all the time. I needed the package 2 days ago. They don't seem to care. They're always blaming somebody but not themselves, unbelievable. On their site it says second delivery attempted, that's a laugh. Home all day cameras on monitors on. No one showed up so no one made an attempt on it. I guess it'll go to the third day now and I'll say the same thing and then they'll send it to a UPS store for me to pick up. That's so unbelievable.

They said there is a 2 day delay on my parcel now because they are 'too busy', they dont work weekends so my parcel wont even be attempted to be delivered until next Monday as they dont deliver on weekends.  Refused to put me onto a manager, refused to let me put a complaint in and kept saying ""its not my fault youll have to just wait"".  bare in mind this parcel was a guaranteed delivery of Thursday at 9am-12, so I have to wait another 4 days before a delivery attempt is even made.  Surely the company can be fined for stuff like this? im glad I recorded my call as when I tried to call again they said that I'd never even been in touch with them about the parcel, but confirmed that it would indeed not be delivered until next week, there is nothing they can do, nothing they will offer, and refused management to speak to me and refused to take this as a complaint.

Okay, finally get access, but the path to waiving the signature is very ambiguous. It says something like package released, not signature waived. If you want to change the delivery date, they charge you $10! Gee, thanks UPS. I have much better experiences with FedEx, but wasn't given a choice.

1,bro trying to scam as much as possible,"When my package encountered customs clearance issues, I was not informed or given the option to self-clear the items as permitted under Canadian customs regulations. They only said my package lacked info and I did even give them my email for further contact or if I need to do sth. In fact, UPS did not contact me after that and, instead, proceeded with the clearance process on my behalf, which led to this significant and unexpected fee. $35 for the government charge (legitimate).$109 for UPS’s ""brokerage service fee"" (unjustifiable).(My family already paid $63 upfront for shipping this small package of personal items to me)I was fully capable of self-clearing, but UPS denied me this legal right by failing to notify me when the package required clearance. Instead, they justified their actions with a canned response that included assumptions like:""""UPS automatically handles the clearance for several reasons:•Most individuals don't have their own customs broker.•Many commercial customs brokers don't handle personal shipments.•Individuals often can't be reached at home during the day to provide clearance information.•UPS' automatic clearance for individuals speeds up the process for prompt delivery.The shipment has been consigned to UPS for customs clearance and the package was released on November 07, 2024. I am afraid that a request for Clears own is no longer possible for a High-Value/Dutiable shipment that has been released from customs.""""??? Is that the reason they can proceed with their extra service and now force me to pay for their insane fee, for what I did not want ?? I did not want UPS to act as my broker wth. Looks like I have come to the phase when I can do nothing but pay for their fee lol.Many individuals, including myself, are fully capable and willing to handle self-clearance if notified promptly. UPS’s assumption that individuals “may not be reachable during the day” does not excuse their failure to provide this option. The careful use of the phrase ""may not be"" implies that such situations are only possibilities, not certainties, and cannot justify denying customers the opportunity to self-clear.To illustrate, UPS did call me once to request some information related to my package and my address. However, at no point during that call did they mention anything about self-clearance. In fact, as instructed by their customer service representative, I even provided my email address to ensure I could be contacted if any further actions were required. Yet, I never received any follow-up emails from UPS. Why?This entire situation is utterly ridiculous. What UPS did and the reasons they provided are unacceptable. They deprived me of the opportunity to exercise my legal right to self-clear and instead imposed a service that I neither requested nor agreed to.Speeding up the process should not come at the expense of transparency and customer consent. Moreover, how can UPS assume I even needed the process to be expedited?To make matters worse, when I contacted UPS customer service multiple times, I received conflicting and misleading explanations. At different points, I was told I couldn’t self-clear because my package was a ""high-value shipment"" or my package was addressed to an individual,...What’s even more troubling is the broader implication of their practices. If I, as an informed individual, feel scammed, imagine how they exploit the elderly or busy customers who may not know their rights.UPS, stop hiding behind assumptions and deceptive policies. Transparency and customer consent should come first, not forcing unnecessary fees on unsuspecting customers. I will never recommend their service to anyone in my whole life, if I know anyone who intends to use their service, obviously I will try to convince them to use it from other places.",2024-11-27 19:18:41,CA

1,UPS Scanners measured a box outrageously WRONG. UPS Billing says their scanners NEVER make mistakes.,"We are a small shipper and spend roughly $1000/month with UPS. We shipped a CUSTOM BOX that we have manufactured specifically for us. The box measures 36x22x2 according to our manufacturer. We charge our customers for shipping at our actual cost from UPS, so the SIZE of the box is important to recoup our charges. Our past experience with UPS is such that we always enter the box size 1"" more than the size of the box so we don't always get hit by UPS for adjustments to the size that we can't subsequently pass on the the customer. In other words, when we ship a 36x22x2 box, we enter the size as 37x23x3. We shipped a 36x22x2 box weighing 4.2 lbs from Arizona to Louisiana. We entered the dimensions as 37x23x3. According to our UPS system, our cost was 27.78 -- which we charged our customer for shippingUPS ""lasers"" scanned the box as 41x 22x15 and charged an additional 76.62 as an ""adjustment"" on our bill. In other words, we charged our customer 27.78 to ship and UPS charged us 104.40 for the same box.We called to dispute this and questioned how a box that is 2"" high can be scanned as 15"" high.We received no response other than ""it is what it is""....our scanners don't make mistakes."" I called our UPS rep as well. The rep never bothered to respond.So we just ""ate"" the additional cost and lost money on the transaction because of shipping.What can one do? Oh, I forgot, there's FedEx whose always calling to see whether we want to change our primary shipper.Right now, the only reason we stay with UPS is that we like our route driver, Steven. But any more s**t like this from them OR any change in route driver will result in an immediate switch to FedEx.",2024-11-26 18:32:41,US

1,All Items In My Package Stolen,"If I could leave zero stars I would. I dropped off a package at a UPS access point in my hometown that successfully passed through two UPS facilities before arriving at the Easton, PA location. The package arrived at a UPS facility in Edison, NJ, where it was damaged & stated that the merchandise was missing and the empty box was discarded. The tracking information stated the sender would be notified, which I never was. Sounds to me like someone at the Easton warehouse stole $200 worth of Dr. Martens boots that were in the box to be exchanged for a different size. I called UPS customer service, who was not helpful at all & told me I need to contact the recipient & they need issue me a refund or contact UPS to begin an investigation. Dr Martens does not have a US phone number to contact, only email, which makes this process even more complicated but I'm not sure why UPS thinks Dr. Martens should even be responsible for issuing me a refund for something that is not their fault. UPS needs to be held accountable, the Easton, PA warehouse specifically. Someone's kids are getting a really nice xmas present this year, and now it won't be mine. Thanks UPS",2024-11-19 23:45:38,US

1,Ups in Canada is the worst company to…,Ups in Canada is the worst company to ship with. They tried delivering my package 3 times last week but I was not home. I got home on sat and requested a drop off at a certain location that is 6 cities away from me about an hour and a half drive depending on traffic.  I call them today (Monday) to confirm I can pick up. Ups customer service agent confirmed pick up at that location for today. I should mention there is duty to be paid on this. So this afternoon I go there to pick it up and the guy working at customer care told me they put it on a truck and shipped it to my house. So I pay the duty get my receipt.  I then run home to meet the driver and no one shows up. So I call ups customer care again and they tell me it’s in route to the place I left to come home. So I asked to talk to a manager.  This manager assured me I would get my package by 7 pm tonight. So at 6 pm I go onto the app to check the status and it says an attempt was made but I wasn’t available.  So again I call customer care and explained everything again. She asked me to confirm my address so I did and she told me the delivery person tried to deliver to the wrong address. she said ok I’ve requested to to be delivered tonight and that the delivery person will call me and they would call back to confirm I received my package.  So 9pm rolls around and nothing so I call customer care to find out where it is. They tell me that the manager left notes and redirected it to me I stopped her and said yes I know and the attempt was made but the delivery person tried to deliver it to the wrong address. She immediately said ok I will get a manger to assist you. Now the manager comes on and says my package won’t be delivered tonight because they only deliver till 7 pm. I was so mad I was cursing ( I do feel bad it’s not her fault) so now my package will be delivered to a nearby access  point. So now we wait till tomorrow.,2024-11-19 05:08:18,CA

1,UPS needs to get erased from existence,"UPS needs to get erased from existence, to say the least. Unreliable.Irresponsible. Untrustworthy. Misleading.Unhelpful customer service. Parcel was not delivered to the correct address. It was not on-time. It never arrived at the confirmed correct address, despite claiming otherwise. This company should never had the opportunity to handle anyone’s parcel- their carelessness costs people time, effort and money.  The first time the parcel was shipped out, no notice of delivery was ever placed; making the sender and receiver run around on a wild chase-and-hunt for the package! Once it was sent back and re-shipped, it arrived one month later after countless hassles, wasted time and continued irritation, with some of the contents being destroyed. Despite the large label indicating it was a Fragile parcel, it came torn up with multiple valuable items being broken and  damaged beyond repair. Customer service is placed in East Asia where standard robotic answers are given without any logic, compassion or understanding. UPS is the most horrifically awful experience I have ever ver had with a company; so much so that my first negative (yet justified and deserving) review had to be written.

1,I am loathe to write a negative review…,I am loathe to write a negative review as the driver that collects and delivers parcels to/from me is excellent. Unfortunately that is the point at which UPS customer service ends. Consequently I am going to have to find another carrier. Sent a parcel to Germany in September. Heard nothing until the recipient complained as his order hadn't arrived. No contact made from UPS to either myself as the sender or to the recipient. I had to go through their terrible website to try and speak to someone and work out what the issue was with the parcel. It transpired some information was missing. This was provided and acknowledged by UPS. They then proceeded to 'lose' the parcel and made me complete a trace form. I did this and requested that if it was located it still needed to be delivered to the consignee. The parcel was located. And then proceeded to be returned to me. By the time it arrived back in the UK there was a big hole in the side of the box and one item was missing from inside. I provided all the evidence I was asked for and since then have been sent round and round in circles and am none the wiser as to whether my claim for the missing item has been accepted. All I keep being given is nonsense about UPS terms and conditions and how important their customer care is to them. To add insult to injury I have now been sent an invoice for the return of the parcel that should have been safely delivered to the recipient in Germany. AND I had to pay to re-ship a new order. It is now mid November and I am still dealing with this single shipment. I have tried to remain loyal as I really like the local UPS driver but after this I am going to be using an alternative carrier.,2024-11-16 02:17:47,GB

This was a blatant lie as the office still had the document and no one showed up to pick up. I waited a few days and still no pick up. I went online, but it stated that my pick up is complete and the charged the fee from my bank account. How can a big corporation like UPS have no integrity in services? I called the customer service and after a long hold, I was informed by the representative that “oh it was an error”. What an error? It is lies and fabricating information. This is unacceptable and I think people should think twice before using UPS. All the representative cared about was passing me on to a number where I could get refunded.

It astonishes me that they are still in business honestly, and I cannot until they finala go out oof business. I honestly do not understand how anyone is still using UPS. Their customer service is a joke. Whenever I call, I get 5 different answers on procedures from 5 different agents.User interaction even worst than customer service. You just need to stay home on the days they estimate delivery în, and pray, else you need to wait for another day. No one can EVER get in touch with their precious couriers to ask for at least a time frate for delivery. Note, you just have to wait or make sure someone is home full day on the days they say they will deliver. Even if there is someone at home and you call 20 times to see wether they will get in that day, they will lie and say they attempted delivery. My last experience they told me I cannot change the delivery address until they attempt to deliver to initial address for the first time.

1,UPS Kills 3 Endangered Species Through Negligence.  Accepts No Responsibility.,I had tropical fish shipped through UPS.  They were critically endangered species in the wild and only available as captive bred.  Expensive.  Paid for 1 day shipping.  The driver claimed the business was closed at 2:45pm and rescheduled delivery for the next day.  Business in question was a Pharmachoice/UPS Drop location.  Not closed and a bit offended when they called in my tracking number and heard UPS's message claiming they were.  The extra 24 hrs of shipping and outside temperature meant the fish arrived to me with little signs of life and very cold.  3 of 7 were DOA.  UPS is responsible for the death of 3 animals on the endangered species list because their driver is a lying POS.  Called customer service multiple times and 2 times was told a supervisor would call me back.  That still has not happened.  They just don't care.  So in the days of social media I will make it my mission to continually post my story in Facebook tropical fish groups in an effort to cost them exponentially more than they cost me because they make exponentially more than I make.  1 star is too generous.,2024-11-14 07:38:01,CA

They didn't look at the apt number on the package they just let it at another apartment with their items they had got. I new it was delivered because I was home and say the notification. But didn't ring the door bell or anything. I had to go in and see where it was left. At apt 33 and I'm apt 36.

1,DO NOT USE UPS,"DO NOT USE UPS - UNPROFESSIONAL PEOPLE WITH NO RESPONSIBILITYTerrible. Got given notice that they would arrive on 8/11/2024 and they did not turn up. Then on 11/11/2024, while I was working, someone from UPS rang me on my mobile, while I was with a patient multiple times. I had to turn my phone off. I took one whole day off work on 12/11/2024. Took another day off work on 12/11/2024 and waited in my apartment the whole day, did now shower, did not eat, did not use the toilet as I did not want to miss out on the delivery. The man came, buzz at the gate and when I pressed the reply button, did not wait and left. I waited for a few minutes, in case he will ring again and he did not. I ran down to the foyer of the apartment and there was no delivery person. I missed my delivery. Rang the help line and was advised they will come in an hour and then received a phone call that they will not be coming and will come again tomorrow (13/11/2024). I told them that I work 6 days a week and cannot take another day off (as I have a mortage, bills to pay, was meant to go to the bank, had a car accident recently and did not get my car repaired as I was waiting for this delivery) and told the man that I cannot wait another day, for a delivery person who cannot buzz twice or wait a few minutes, the man's reply, ""that is your opinion"". I asked him ""what it that suppose to mean"" and he answered ""that is in some people's opinion"". Well guess what... it was recorded in the apartment camera, so I don't think it's my opinion. I asked if they could send it to a shop in Melbourne (my third phone call) -> a female shouted at me and told me that I will just need to wait until next Tuesday. Unfortunately, some of us have work, mortgages and bills to pay, we cannot wait 3 days for a delivery and a delivery man who cannot even wait 10 secs.",2024-11-12 07:36:53,AU

UPS' customer service reps who simply could not understand what had happened. After several painstaking explanations, they've now committed to resolving this on Monday - way too late for the wedding. During this time, they kept promising how quickly they would resolve the issue, only to let me down time and time again. Cheers UPS, now I'll need to scramble for something else to wear.

Afternoon, getting another email from UPS asking to update the contact number and address and said will deliver next day and on next day afternoon when I checked tracking details, it says it is still at the sorting facility and not out for delivery.

1,Worst Delivery Service Ever,"UPS is, without question, the worst delivery service I've ever dealt with. Every single time they’re involved, something goes wrong. My packages are either delivered to the wrong address, dumped at some distant pick-up point five blocks away (despite paying for home delivery), or worse, they just vanish. I’ve had multiple heavy parcels that I specifically ordered for home delivery because of their weight, only to find out they’re sitting at a pick-up spot far away. I then have to drag these oversized, heavy boxes home myself. It's infuriating.But this latest experience has taken it to a whole new level of incompetence. I ordered from an international website, completely unaware that they used UPS for delivery. Big mistake. A week has gone by, and I still haven’t received my order. When I checked the tracking, I found that UPS claims it was delivered two days ago to someone named ""HEMIN."" Who is ""HEMIN""? There’s no one by that name in my building, and I certainly didn’t authorize any ""HEMIN"" to receive my packages. I provided my full address and apartment number, so there is absolutely no excuse for this kind of mix-up.This service is beyond terrible. It’s unreliable, careless, and a complete disaster.

When I got to my shop, I called UPS only to be sent to some number, said it was the billing dept but it was in the Phillipines, go figure. This was Monday, i called them and MY bank Bank of America to try and resolve it. It is now Friday, UPS is now in possession of $616.75 for my invoice, (which they were paid for the very next day through my account) and they are still asking for $616.75 on a submission done on the same day as the other one Nov 3rd,  and it is still in processing, holding still another $616.75 out of my acct, completely strangling my account, bring my balance below zero now, because other planned charges have tried to go through, now adding fees on to my acct. I just got someone on the phone in the accts payable dept and he said oh this may take weeks to resolve. I'm sorry what????? it took you 2 seconds to take it out, put it back.

This is unacceptable because it’s all lies! FedEx shipped my wife something for me in May and it arrived on the third day to her in Colombia and they are definitely the way to go. I have called UPS and they are just absolutely careless when it comes to this and don’t care that you spend your hard earned money and get lied to about this type of stuff!

This was then delayed with no explanation for almost another week and when it arrived only one small piece from my delivery arrived. Someone from UPS had STOLEN the rest of the delivery, cut out the delivery label and stuck a new one on top and onto the small item just to be able to say ‘the package was delivered’. I opened a case with the company I bought from and had to send pictures and details to them and to UPS. Its now been 3 weeks (5 weeks since I originally ordered the items) and I still have not heard a verdict.

The lack of professionalism I encountered has left me feeling not only disregarded as a potential employee but also embarrassed and inconvenienced.I was instructed to come in for an orientation, which led me to make childcare arrangements and adjust my personal schedule accordingly. Upon my arrival, however, I was greeted in a way that made me feel unwelcome. No one introduced themselves, and I was left waiting in a room for what seemed to be an extended period of time without any communication or acknowledgment of my presence.Eventually, I was moved to another room where a staff member—whose name was never provided to me—struggled to log into the computer and appeared unprepared to proceed with the orientation. Despite the fact that my paperwork indicated I was hired, the disorganization and lack of communication were unprofessional and made me question the reliability of the hiring process at your facility.Moreover, after he took down my contact information, I was assured I would receive follow-up communication. However, I have yet to receive any contact from your office regarding next steps, further adding to my frustration and disappointment.As a candidate who was directed to attend orientation under the impression that my employment was secured, I feel this experience reflects poorly on the standards of UPS. The time I invested, as well as the personal accommodations I made, were disregarded. I hope that future candidates are treated with the courtesy and respect that should be expected from a reputable company like UPS. Now the job isn't available? I'm confused. I have all documents and proof this was humiliating!!!!",2024-11-06 05:18:39,US

1,Grand newphew's party missed because of them,My grand nephew's birthday was this past Sunday on the 3rd of November. I made an order from amazon for a big Monster Truck because loves them. UPS was suppose to have made the delivered to me and it was stated as being on the 1st of November. I got all excited for nothing because before the 1st they sent me an update stating it would be here on the 2nd. Well I still had more time to get it go to my nephew's party and give him his truck. The 2nd came and I get an email saying they couldn't deliver my package. So without a gift I did not go to the party because it would be me empty handed which my mom understood the reasoning. Today the 4th I wake up to see them instead of sending my package to my address they decided to send it to a pick up spot. I called them to have this sent to my address instead yet when I spot to my original delivery guy he stated that he did not have the package. So I called them again and now they are stating that I won't get it until Tuesday ( another day from work which would be 3 days in total). I don't understand UPS being such a huge company can't figure out this is 2024 and even the most lowest fast foods uses text or phone calls to let you know they are at your place.

1,Verbally assaulted and items thrown at me.,"UPS Store16869 SW 65th Ave Lake Oswego, OR 97035On Wednesday, October 9th I went to the above-referenced store because I was told I had a package returned after an attempted delivery. There should not have been any issues with the delivery. I was told that it was taken to an access point, at which I asked if a notice would have been left and I confirmed that one was not. I asked the customer service representative helping me if I could get a refund and use the amount to send the package to another address to ensure delivery. I was informed that was not policy. I told him that was fine, and could I please see the Shipment Details and I could go from there. He was printing pages out and I was waiting. At that time, I received another call from my attorney. I was speaking with him and only him. Dave - took it upon himself to assume I was speaking about him. I was not. I would never. He was helping me. He proceeded to scream at me. ""You can't call me an idiot"" and threw the printed pages at me. I told him I was not talking about him at all. And I never said ""idiot"" during my conversation. I apologized if that was what he thought and he continued to scream at me that he did not care and launched himself at me and told me to get out. I was in such shock and started to get scared. I didn't know what else to say or do. So, I left. The store had other customers, so you can imagine how humiliated I was.This is completely inappropriate.

After 5 ""attempted deliveries"" not a single piece of proof was left that the driver had attempted the delivery.

Support lies and tells you that they are updating your case and will ensure the package arrives; it's a bunch of BS. They couldn't even explain why there was no InfoNotice left, they said they don't keep any record of whether the driver does leave one/what the number is.

1,Never trust UPS for any package that is…,"Never trust UPS for any package that is important to you.We happened to use a UPS store when we were in Glenburnie by chance. Our package got lost on the way by the UPS carrier. We tried calling the store but they never pick up the phone nor answer voice messages. After a long frustrating ordeal dealing with UPS customer service and its claim section, we were offered a 100 dollar reimbursement for the lost package whose value was way higher than it. Apparently that was the declared amount which I never did, and also apparently I agreed to all terms when I payed the shipping fees whose conditions I was never informed. I supposed to read a long document when there was a queue of customers waiting for their turn at the store.We refused the compensation, asked UPS to find the package and the reply we got was always "" ask the store to find it for you"".Then we had to go back to Glenburnie with hopes of getting help to find our package. When we got back to the store, we got no help from them. We were told to go to Laurel where the package was taken to from the store, but whose location even the store manager does not know! We had to find the location using google and taking the best guess. It was a big warehouse where the guards did not let us go inside or talk to any rep. Just a wild goose trip for which we had taken a leave of absence from work.Basically it was our mistake to trust UPS based on hearsay. UPS is here for business only, and it does not care to investigate if a package is lost through them. Just file the claims form is what you will hear from its reps. And they want you to be self aware about its insurance and lost packages policies which we were stupidly naive about.Long story short, if you cannot have your package lost, never use UPS because that is always a possibility and a big business like this will not care to find one lost package. You should have taken insurance is what the answer you will find out.",2024-10-31 05:32:03,US

Waited all day and no delivery.   The tracking said they would reschedule.  They did in the middle of the following week.  Still doesn't work for me. Tried numer of ways to use the virtual assistant with absolutely no luck finally called and the person said I either needed a friend to ba at my house to sign or pay 7.99 to have it delivered to the ups store.  I'm not going to have a friend wait in a four hour windows where it may or may not be delivered.  So I paid the money to have it delivered to the hospital store.

I sent a couple Christmas gifts to my grandson it has been in transit for 10 days they keep saying it's the wrong address I call UPS I corrected three times now and he still has not got the package. They say they don't know why it hasn't been delivered because the correct address is on the box but when they scan it another address comes up. Simple Solution but they can't figure it out.

Occurs repeatedly. Allegedly retries a delivery and the same occurs (!). Apparently, UPS employees do not make any delivery attempts and instead simply drop them off wherever and go home (!).Online complaints form doesn't work, refuses to register your complaint, vaguely claims they need ""more information"" without specifying what, and instructs you to call them to provide unspecified ""more information"" about a package they should've delivered 1 week ago (!).Unhelpful support, claims they cannot locate your package despite tracking showing otherwise and forwards you to the seller.At least they replied my e-mails and promised an internal investigation...",2024-11-19 15:41:57,PT

I entered my tracking number and selected the option to have it left somewhere so I could pick it up, and each time (I tried twice a day, changing and refreshing browsers, for two business days and a weekend) an error message said there were technical difficulties and to try again later, and there was no phone number available online to call and the chat service only gave me useless FAQ responses.  I then called the local UPS shop where I was given a number and an automated voice told me that I would be charged 6$ to pick it up.

But now I'd have to deal back with the shipper for new arrangements once they get it back.  (Why can't you turn it around and direct it back for delivery - - it was YOUR error???   Terrible company.

UPS have managed to contact us fine to take import duty which not sure we should even have paid so clearly have had the items in their possession.  The items have been showing since 26th October as being at Stanford-Le-Hope.  Updates show delivery today however tracking info not moved.  We scheduled workloads so one of us could be here so we did not miss delivery.  It got to late afternoon and nothing had changed and so went onto online chat which gave same delivery info.  Asked to speak to human and they asked for our number and said they would call within 6 minutes - no call.  Went back onto chat and they then provided a customer service telephone number which I called.  Sunday in Customer Service offered an unapologetic service, she could not tell me where the packages were and just sent through a claim form which does not kick in until after 10 days.  She could not confirm whether the 5 large parcels had been lost or not and really wasn't concerned.  I have had one other negative experience from this organisation.  They really do not seem to be using negative feedback to up their game.  We did not have a choice in courier but would not have used them out of choice.",2024-10-28 19:45:10,GB
1,Extremely Disappointed with UPS Service,"Profound dissatisfaction with the service provided by UPS. My recent experience has been nothing short of horrendous. I had a package that was supposed to be shipped domestically, and yet it took an astonishing 20 days to arrive.This delay is completely unacceptable and speaks to the inefficiency and lack of organization within UPS. Throughout this period, there was a complete lack of communication and transparency about the whereabouts of my package. Tracking updates were sporadic and unhelpful, leaving me in the dark about the status of my shipment.Moreover, when I reached out to customer service for assistance, I was met with vague responses and no real solutions. The entire process was messy and frustrating, showcasing a level of incompetence that is not expected from a reputed courier service.UPS needs to address these significant issues and improve their logistics and customer service operations. As it stands, I cannot in good conscience recommend their services to anyone seeking a reliable and efficient delivery experience.",2024-10-28 18:57:17,CA

There was another one earlier today, which said estimated arrival time was 1.43pm, but then at 12.03 pm I just got a text from UPS, and apparently, the driver was here at 11.38pm, my apartment has no entry code so I guess he left right away without even bother attempting to reach out to me. What's the point of 'live tracking' if it's not even in real-time.

He informed her that he was not going to walk up her driveway every time she needed a package delivered and he was going to get the names and addresses of all the neighbors that had driveways similar to hers and when he had packages for them, he was going to take them across the street to the local propane company and leave them there.  He said it would be up to the propane company to notify the people that their package was left there and too bad if they didn't let you know.  He repeated himself several times and was extremely pissed off that he had to walk her package up the driveway.  My mother is 87 years old and certainly did not deserve to be treated that way.  She is now afraid to order anything again for fear of being in trouble.  It is beyond ridiculous that a driver representing a company that he works for would behave in such a manner.  I will be contacting UPS and will continue to call every day until someone responds to this issue.  My mother has had many packages delivered to her home by UPS and NEVER had an issue with a driver until now.",2024-10-24 14:24:26,US

1,Terrible Experience,"I am writing to express my disappointment with the service I have received from UPS over the past two months concerning two separate orders.First Order: There was an unjustified delay in delivery, as UPS claimed my address had missing information. After a three-day hold, I contacted UPS and verified that the address was complete and accurate. Yet, it took an additional three days for the delivery to be made, resulting in a total delay of one week.Second Order: Recently, I encountered the same issue again. This time, I was informed via email that I needed to pick up the order myself, which is confusing as I regularly receive orders from Amazon without such issues. Moreover, this particular order contained first aid supplies, and as someone who is unable to walk to pick up the package, the situation became even more stressful and problematic.This repeated problem has caused unnecessary delays and frustration, and it’s particularly concerning because UPS is the only service where I face this issue. I would appreciate it if UPS could investigate why this keeps happening with my orders and work to ensure that I don’t experience similar problems in the future.Please advise on how UPS plans to address this issue and improve the reliability of its service in my area.",2024-10-24 06:21:09,CA

Then, after going through the Virtual Assistant and then being put to a live rep, who then transferred me to my local area, and I waited for about 25 minutes to speak to someone again.

1,Vandalism by UPS,"Today I received a valuable collector item delivered by UPS. The outside of the box was intentionally punctured several times (pictures attached). I am being targeted by Marsha the manager at Benwood, WV, and the driver because of a recent complaint I posted through the BBB a month ago.It is not possible that these types of violent puncture holes randomly happened in transit. Transit damage is usually the box is crushed or corners creased, but this was someone intentionally stabbing the box several times in a violent manner.As shown in the pictures this is clearly several stab like punctures that were inflicted on the box 9 times. The punctures went through the shipping box and into my collectors box. This will hurt the future value as a collectible. How else could such deep punctures happen if not intentionally?I am very, very concerned by the targeting and outright disregard that is being shown by UPS. Marsha of Benwood WV UPS mocked me and hung up on me twice in my previous dealings. She made a joke of the whole incident.The last incident a pair of shoes was missing, and the blame was put on the Shoe company. But this time? The manufacturing company did not stab this box 9 times before shipping it. There is no excuses this time and it is obvious that the driver is retaliating against me and this has to be stopped. This is the 2nd incident in a month and I am documenting this to protect myself against this outright assault and vandalism.My next steps are to contact my attorney and file a report with the local police for vandalism, targeting, and harassment. This is now is a Federal crime.I also attached the picture the UPS driver took of the delivery verification. It is quite odd he only took a blurry picture of the steps to my house. Why do this? It is because he intentionally damaged the box and did not want to show this in the picture.",2024-10-24 02:17:19,US

They said that it was related to ""import"". They didn't even mention it before the delivery attempts. After the last delivery attempt, they are asking the import fee. I paid for that. And they attempted again in the next business day, around 9:00 PM. I was at home.

1,Useless Parcel Service,"On 20 September 2024 I ordered a new Emma mattress from John Lewis, as I was suffering neck pains because of my existing mattress. On 23 September 2024 John Lewis notified me that the item had been dispatched, that UPS were the couriers and that delivery would normally be made within two working days.I then heard nothing from UPS.On 2 October 2024 I contacted John Lewis to complain. On 2 or 3 October 2024 John Lewis informed me that the mattress would be delivered on 4 October 2024. Again, I heard nothing from UPS. I waited in for them, but they did not deliver the mattress on 4 October 2024, so I contacted John Lewis late that afternoon.On 7 October 2024 John Lewis informed me that Emma had confirmed that UPS had lost the item in transit. I replied that I would like a replacement mattress and asked them to expedite the order, though I also said that I would be away from 11 to 18 October inclusive. On 8 October 2024 John Lewis notified me that the replacement mattress had been dispatched and that delivery would normally be made within two working days. I replied that I was available any date from 21 October onwards.Once again, I heard nothing from UPS, so after I returned from my holiday, on the afternoon of Friday 18 October 2024, I contacted John Lewis to press for a firm delivery date. They came back to me and said they had been told that the mattress would be delivered either the same day or on Monday 21 October 2024. Yet again, I heard nothing from UPS. I waited in for them but the mattress was not delivered on 18 or 21 October 2024. John Lewis contacted me on 21 October 2024 to say that the mattress would not be delivered on that date. I said I was no longer available on 22 October 2024 but could do 23 October 2024. On 22 October 2024 John Lewis rang me to say that they had been told that the mattress would be delivered on 23 October 2024.I waited in for UPS on 23 October 2024. They delivered the mattress that day without contacting me in advance. The driver said it was the original mattress and that he had made several unsuccessful previous attempts to deliver it. This was the first time anyone had suggested this to me. No one had ever put a card through my door to say that they had tried to deliver the mattress.In summary, UPS repeatedly:1.	Delayed delivering the mattress.2.	Failed to contact me to arrange a convenient delivery date.3.	Failed to deliver the mattress on dates I had been given.The delay in replacing the previous mattress has caused me considerable pain, and UPS’s failures have wasted a great deal of my time and caused me to cancel unnecessarily activities I would have liked to do.A truly Useless Parcel Service.

1,Avoid this clown company,"Well, it looks like a LOT of people have beat me to the lowest rating possible. I'll be another. I applied for a seasonal delivery person. A week later I believe I received a message saying I was hired. That's awesome! It told me the pay and had me verify it was acceptable. It then kept giving me links for paperwork to fill out. I immediately got started but I couldn't unlock the W4 and I9. I used my mobile first, then used the desktop, then visited multiple places all to get the forms unlocked. I tried calling the number given to me for help but couldn't get through. I finally got it. I was told of the photos I needed to submit then would have them ready only to be told I needed more. My insurance one was rejected then resubmitted the exact same photo since I only had an electronic copy. Oddly, it went through the second time. Same for one of the photos for my car. I spent an excessive amount of time with them coming back and needing more. Finally, I get to the end and now I need someone who is standing with me to get this completed because they wanted a witness to verify my documents instead of taking them to HR like a real company does. All going smoothly....ish and I get to the end to watch an onboarding video and watch it through to the end. They want me to confirm that I watched it and then I get taken to a page that said this position is filled and to apply for something else. I'm completely confused because I had been told I was hired and had 10 days to complete the process. I wasn't going to wait that long so I started immediately. The hold up was THEIR site not working, having to resubmit the same info, and thinking I had everything done for them to basically reply ""kidding, we need this, too."" (X5) I have never had a more lengthy and frustrating process. Ever. If you need a job don't take these clowns, seriously. I would like to add that I called immediately after that really confusing last message about the position being filled. For starters, they didn't say first come first serve (not sure if that would have made a difference with their site not working) but the guy I finally reached said there were openings in 2 other cities: one out of state and the other a 3 hour round trip. I told him basically to get bent and I was leaving reviews everywhere. Don't waste people's time and resources who are looking for employment. I will never use their service again.

1,Completely Disappointed with UPS Service.,"I am absolutely furious with UPS and their handling of my recent shipment. Their incompetence has cost me time, money, and endless frustration. I shipped 8 packages from Alberta, Canada, to California, USA, and it has been a complete disaster from start to finish. Despite confirming the address multiple times, providing directions, and even suggesting alternative solutions, UPS kept giving me the runaround, with the status constantly bouncing between “More Information Needed” and “On the Way.”Now, I’m getting even more mixed messages. I received a text saying the shipping labels are missing and that they would send the packages back unless I paid for a new delivery attempt. Meanwhile, another agent is supposedly investigating and will contact me later. To make matters worse, they are now saying that the packages may be missing entirely.These shipments contained important information, including documents related to my university and professional designation, which I explicitly ensured were to be handled with care. The idea that these vital items could be lost because of UPS's incompetence is beyond infuriating.To claim that UPS is not responsible for the additional costs and inconvenience I’m facing is unacceptable. It’s absurd that a company of their supposed reputation would handle this so poorly and then dismiss their responsibility.This entire experience has left me deeply disappointed. The lack of accountability and customer care is shocking. I expected better from UPS, but this situation has completely shattered my trust in their service.

They tell you the package is coming days after it was estimated to be with you, but won’t let you amend the delivery instructions or add any driver instructions without signing up for an account and then verifying your address by having a letter sent to your house (how is that going to be of any use when a parcel is already on its way to you?!!) and then on the day tell you that the parcel requires a signature, by which time you can’t redirect it to one of their centres or change anything about the delivery via the tracking link or the pointless account you now have.

I could guess, I have to pay $126 on online if I want to my package. I called CS let them explain about $126. The associate said it's just what UPS do. I said I only paid with Canada Post $50 or less (can't clearly remember but I'm sure it was around $30) I kept asking why I have to pay $126 for $376 order? He passed me to their accounting department, the answer was same. Every company are different that only the guy could say. I said but why I have to pay $126?? so on. After my steam is down, I didn't want other headache rise so I decided to pay it. Went to their website as they said, Went through all the process but the blue bottom didn't work to pay.

Neighbor calls and informs us of this so I go to chat with an agent and ask what’s going on. Agent says neighbor delivery isn’t available for my package even tho it was approved the night before and basically tries to pin the blame on me and tells me I need to figure out another way to get the package. I set the package to be re-delivered at my home on the same day and cut my day short to be home for that. Hours pass with no update on my package and we wait and wait. My spouse goes outside to check just in case and finds a slip of paper under the wheel of the recycling bin saying they missed us and are taking the package to a facility. No one knocked on our door or attempted to contact us for the delivery. I get back in contact with customer service and they tell me the driver is now too far and he won’t turn back and he hasn’t scanned the package so they can’t see an update of where he’s taking it.

1,DO NOT Trust UPS With Your Packages….,"I am beyond enraged at the way UPS handled my package. I am a freshman at the University of Oklahoma and my father shipped a large box I had made with items inside from my room. I could not fit the package in my sedan which was already packed with my other stuff so that’s why we shipped it. First off, the package took 2 weeks to arrive, and when it did, the package was nearly completely destroyed, with multiple large holes and tears on all sides where you could see the items inside easily. Numerous items were missing and many were damaged and shattered into pieces. My father has called UPS numerous times but no one answers and he is left on hold for a long time, and because he has to work he cannot stay on the phone for hours on end, which is ridiculous, so UPS’s customer service is non existent. The box was brought to the wrong address the first time which is why it took so long to get to me, and the person who shipped the package to that wrong address took a terrible photo that was pixelated and sideways where you could barely make out that there’s a box sitting up against a garage, and it looked as if the shipper was in a hurry and took the photo while driving, showing that this shipper does not drive safely and does not care about anyone’s packages. I have now lost a 2 TB Xbox hard drive that had ALL my games and progress on it, all my university documents, my AirPod Pros, and numerous items inside were damaged or destroyed and shattered into pieces as mentioned before. Just another instance of a large company getting away with wrongdoing and because they have so much money and are such a large company I imagine they could care less about me or my items, and they have made it as hard as possible to get your money back for the items lost. They force you to provide a value of the lost items, which is impossible for some of them because I do not know the value of my university documents that were lost, and they also want you to provide the EXACT name of the items word for word, and that is also nearly impossible to do for most of my items, so they will not give you compensation if you can’t do that, and it is set up that way on purpose so they get away with wrongdoing and won’t have to give you any money. Of course if you want to get ALL your money back you have to pay more, a perfect example of corporate greed at its finest. I will never see or receive those lost items again, or get compensation for them. Probably can’t get my money for the lost and damaged items since it’s been almost 2 months since I received the package and I am in a situation where some of the items lost have no known value or I cannot determine their value. Thanks UPS. Great customer service and care for my package.",2024-10-17 10:39:25,US

I tried using their website to change the date, but didn't work. Also tried to change it to be delivered to a UPS point, also didn't work, everything fails. It required me to confirm my identity, but it also fails (this is the only website I experienced this). Ok fine, I'll ask a friend so I'll change to his address - guess what, also fails.

There is zero update as to when it will be delivered and I can't get any more information from the customer service representatives because they only have the same information that the customer has. What the hell is the point of having customer support if they don't have any more information and they can't do anything? Why is my package being held hostage and I'm not allowed to go and pick it up at an office at the warehouse for example?? I know that there are workers there day and night sorting packages so there's somebody there and they could easily pay somebody to let customers drive up and pick up their packages so that we don't have to wait - My particular packages Our instruments that I need to run a five day event in two days and now I have no idea when they're going to be sent to me and I can't leave without them, But I'm also expected to be at the event in the morning two days from now. This is a massive business issue and fk up on UPS's part And they're taking zero responsibility for it.You knew a week ago that there was going to be severe weather disturbances so I don't understand why the hell you're giving me specific dates and times of when my package will be delivered if you know damn well that there's going to be delays! Also to notify me literally when the package is reaching the end of the window of delivery is the worst customer service!! It sounds more like the driver didn't do a very good job and delivering all the packages on his route and instead of continuing to work to finish his route or get help from other drivers (My stepfather has been a UPS driver his entire life so I know very deeply how this works), They're just giving up and bringing my package back to the !$@? warehouse but I'm not allowed to go and pick it up.

1,UPS customer service failure.,"I was expecting a delivery of an extremely expensive custom built computer. UPS indicated a delivery date of Thursday. Due to hurricane Milton delivery did not happen (to be expected). I did expect however the delivery date to be updated though it never did. So I called the first of 8 times.... The first agent says check after 7pm and it ""will be updated"". It was not. I called again and the next agent said, ""just keep checking"" so I did but there was no update. The next agent said ""probably Monday. I thought perhaps I could pick up if it was in town so I called back to simply confirm where the package was. After another phone call or two I was told the package was at my local distribution center and given the address to be clear of it's location. When I tried to arrange pick up the next agent said ""Sorry to tell you but your package is lost you'll need to start a claim. Due to shipper restrictions I could not create a claim so I called back and waited for a supervisor. The agent had to put me on hold but came back periodically to say she was working on getting a supervisor but that ""she wouldn't hang up on me"", thirty seconds later she hung up on me. I called back and the agent told me to explain the situation...again. I almost lost it. They finally got me to a supervisor who said, ""sorry but your package isn't lost, it will probably be delivered Monday."" Yet still no update tracking or concrete information.  What an absolute embarrassment for so called customer service. I represent multiple entities that used to use UPS regularly.

I confirmed through their app that the address on my package was the correct (and same address) that they've been delivering to for over 20 years. This comes on the heals of not delivering another package that they say I requested a delivery change which I never requested. I don't know what has happened with UPS the last year or so, but they have deteriorated to be the worst delivery service in my opinion.

I asked the customer service rep, would they not attempt a delivery again the following day and she confirmed yes, and I don't see how 200 meters on the opposite side of the street should cost $6.00 more to deliver.  Literally, the delivery time changed twice or they would have caught me during the time it was expected and I just would have met the driver.

I've now had to go to the UPS pickup point after them repeatedly lying about delivering the package to pick it up myself.I will be avoiding vendors who use UPS in the future and when given no choice, asking those who do if they can deliver via another because I can't have this keep happening, especially to my expensive packages.",2024-10-09 07:16:48,CA

In my area, if there are parcels left on doorsteps, these packages can be stolen and as it is near Christmas time, it becomes even more likely. A neighbour asked to take it in as we have a nice relationship with them but the delivery driver refused and proceeded to leave it there.

They don’t address emails properly, and it feels like you’re dealing with a clueless machine.UPS Germany/EU, please hire more knowledgeable staff for your billing department.

I finally escalated it to Lawrence Borros in customer service who connected with Marie, a woman named 'Diane' and a supposed supervisor named Helen who first assured me that the package was currently 'out' for delivery (I have email records confirming all of this) before blaming me for inputting the address incorrectly (despite, again, visual evidence of the correct address being listed on the label, before finally confirming that they have LOST the package entirely.

They charge ridiculous prices, leave a notice on my door to pay the fees online scanning a QR code that produces a webpage that tells me the information is invalid. I call for customer service and even the automated response tells me without this number no one can help me. I manage to get to a rep anyway and she is trying to find answers and has no idea, likely getting paid minimum wage to deal with irate customers and give no helpful information. I still can’t access my information or how to pay the crazy duties on a child’s t-shirt, costing more than the shirt itself. No idea when my package will be delivered. I can’t be at my door all day everyday, they don’t have modern tracking like other delivery companies that update you along the drivers route so you at least have an idea of when to be at home and expect your package.

Terrible system, terrible work-design and terrible customer service.","I have a parcel, that was stated to have a delievery at the ""end of the day"", and I noticed that the status at 11:44 changed to ""We are trying to retrieve information for the security/accesscode for the build, for our driver..."" (translated). Since the code is out of order, I decided to contact the customer service. I told them, since I am home, and they have my contact information including phone number and e-mail, that they would just call or text me, when they are here, so I can pick it up at the entrance. However, I was met with not only a rude lady, but also not very understanding one. She explained to me that their drivers don't have any phones, so contacting me is impossible. Having used a dozens of other delievery companies, from allover the world. I have yet to meet a company that dosn't allow their delievery guy to contact the receiver of the package. I couldn't help myself to ask ""what century is this?"", which wasn't very nice, but since we had a little rude chat going on already, I didn't really pay much into it. The lady put me on hold (gave me a time-out), then proceeded to say that their driver would now deliever the package to the nearest drop-off point, but 3 days later. Nearest drop-off point is litterally 20 meter away from where I live. I can even see it from my condo. I asked the lady, why I have to wait an additional 3 days to receive my package, when it's STILL stated to be delievered today, 20 meter from that point. Which she replied, that the driver has probably left the area.However she would try to contact the driver. Probably sending him a letter with a bird or something, since they don't have a phone, or any device that can be used to contact by text, phone or mail. To ask if he is still in the area. At this point, i'm asking her, how come the parcel is stated to be delievered at the end of the day, but the driver is already done in the area at 11:44? It even says on my status/tracking, that it can be as late as 19:00 before they show up, but she told me that ""end of the day"" means 10-17:00, which dosnt align with their own system. My parcel is still due for today, but will probably be moved 3 days later, because it's no longer at deliever by door, but at a drop-off point, 20 meter away from my home. The lady was exceptionally rude for one working at customer service, and had no understanding or will to explain how their system is flawed and dosn't paint a clear picture.",2024-10-04 13:17:08,DK

I received a small note send from UPS. It said that I have to pay the custom duties, and need to send information. any time that passes they will charge more. They provided a phone number a email and parcel number. I already was familiar with that email. I was using it in the past to send information without response. That lead to the small dispute I mentioned earlier. I tried calling that number several times but it was invalid. The actual UPS support could not find the package number in their system. It was at that state for days. And I unable to solve it while still trying and preparing to loose over 300$ and goods in almost the same value. Now the long missing parcel arrived just fine.Turns out that paper slip was a hoax. I think a scammer was supposed to take my call. They got my informations do to the email I sent in the past. Be careful of scammer while using UPS. No one could tell me that it may be a big hoax either.Other than that, prepare for a much longer time to receive your goods as you think.

Ups showed up in our driveway and once I noticed them I was to the gate trying to give this man the box and he pulls out and leaves. I didn't know what to do, as it's not mine. But what's pretty stupid is not only should they have let him know they were coming because it said the return had only been initiated and would update when they were coming, I go to look in the mailbox for the label because I am now gonna have to take it to a ups dropoff location because they can't do a simple job, and theres not anything in there so I'm like what the heck? I go to walk back inside and the label with a note that's literally made to hang on a fence/door knob, is just laying in the ground not even together like the wind blew it around. And I know he didn't even try to hang it up because you had to rip a piece apart to do that and it wasn't ripped until I just done it because I didn't understand why he didn't do that instead of just throwing it in the ground.

1,Garbage company. Beware.,"I paid $98 for overnight shipping. Sent it on Saturday and it was guaranteed by 8am on Monday, which was essential (it was a car key for my friend to get to work), but it didn't arrive. They were no help in locating it and gave us the runaround for a full day while she missed work and we scrambled to figure out how to get her kids to and from school. UPS agreed to a refund but said I had to drive back to the store where I sent it and submit it through them. I was told it would be a full refund, but that UPS would mail me a check in the next 7-10 days rather than refunding my original payment method. The check comes two weeks later and is only a partial refund saying it's for ""shipping fees only."" The only reason I paid for them to ship it was because it was guaranteed on Monday morning! I would have driven it back otherwise. UPS made over 9 billion in PROFIT (net was 91 billion) in 2023. They could spend a fraction of that to hire more people to ensure that they can do the job they are guaranteeing, and they certainly don't need to nickle and dime the customers they screw over. Garbage company.",2024-10-02 22:57:40,US
1,Dishonest and Crazy employees,"This is the most lying, dishonest, corrupt company that exists. I've had many negative experiences with UPS mishandling packages and leaving them on the sidewalk, but this one takes the cake. Their offshore customer service and local facility staff are equally horrible. The issue is clearly with the executive team and their software control over their employees, as well as not letting anyone provide good customer service. I had two packages in the same shipment worth $4000 in products. The driver brought one package to my building and asked me to sign for it (both of them); it was a signature required. I told him I would not sign for one when two were in the delivery. He says he will look for the other after I sign it or deliver it tomorrow. I told him I would sign for both of them both of them. He demands I sign for it, or he threatens to mark it as refused. When I said I was not refusing it, he took my package and ran away with it, shouting, ""I'm keeping it"" like a three year old child. I, of course, called UPS and got their offshore customer service. After being on the phone for two hours, I was promised a 10 am delivery, and that the driver would never deliver here again, and they were talking to the local center according to them. Well, anything they promise is an absolute lie. It turns out the local people don't care what UPS tells me. They say, ""They should not do that,"" but they do, and they refuse to honor it. So it was after 10 am, no package and the same driver was coming to my house. That wasn't very pleasant to me. This is how UPS treats people because I'm not paying their bills directly, so they will cheat and screw everyone over because they don't care about their monopoly. I wish I had just called the police and filed a police report on them instead of calling customer service. It would have been far more productive, and this is the Chicago Police we are talking about, as they wouldn't do anything. For other reasons, I stopped using UPS to ship from my business, but this cements I would never. I ship USPS daily, and my loss rate is 1 out of 500 or $42 product loss on 21k of revenue. For zero headache, I would choose USPS 1000000 times over this garbage-lying company.",2024-10-02 17:38:53,US

How could my products in the same box be lost? The box was completely intact. But only the products inside were missing. The answer is very simple! UPS employees opened my box and stole the products inside. Now they do not take responsibility for this and after prolonging the case for 3 months, they are rejecting my request. Can't we trust such a big company? UPS steals people's products! I will never use UPS again because of these dirty behaviors and I will not let anyone I know use UPS services!

1,UPS needs to not lie about labels of bad weather and delay when there isn’t any bad weather,"If I could give less than 1 rating I would.  Spent $229.80 for UPS 2nd day Air to get perishable items from CT to Huntsville.  Delivery was to be 9/24/24 between 1:45-5:45.Looked up tracking to see that message said delayed due to weather and delivery will be 9/25/24 1:45-5:45.  Detailed history shows package had been sitting in the UPS Huntsville, Alabama facility since 9:04am 9/24/24 with the excuse of bad weather when Huntsville had no bad weather today.  Called customer service with no help and she kept saying there was bad weather.  This is absolutely a joke that the package is sitting in the same town as it needs to be delivered and UPS is using the excuse of bad weather.  Never again will I deal with UPS.  You made sure to get my money and you failed at delivery!!!",2024-09-25 00:49:11,US

Where you decide when you pick up your package.UPS doesn't have that.Suddenly I see on the delivery timeline that my package is in Munich, Germany.Without notifying me.These are practices that show that there is no respect for the customer.And get rid of that chatbot.That is of absolutely no use to you as a customer.In short, you still have many areas to improve your service.Best regards from a disappointed customer",2024-09-24 17:34:24,BE

Called and canceled my account today, but they refused to send an email confirmation. They can only give confirmation numbers over the phone. Who the f*** doesn't send email confirmation these days. Customer Service people are from South East Asia and they do their best, but I need to talk to someone who knows what the hell is actually going on. Also, using PayPal with UPS to pay is a joke. I have $40 on hold with PayPal from 2 weeks ago because the UPS website said ""my payment didn't go through."" UPS nor PayPal will release the funds. I have to wait 30 days for them to drop off. I thought saving money with a UPS shipping account, that I assumed I had canceled and was free, would be worth it, but not. It's been an entire disaster.

You can only change delivery point to ""walking distance"" of your home, and changing it to neighbour or trying to change delivery date gave an error code and phone number to call. That number did not exist. Triple checked the number, called and no. Well, it seems home I'll be on that day.After being home for 6 hours of business hours, I got a notification that delivery was attempted, no other reason to just get the package transported to some UPS Access Point far away.Seriously, even with DHL they give you the options to change times and a working online platform.

1,UPS is delaying my delivery,"UPS is delaying my delivery, when it is already at my destination hub. The reason, I’ve been blacklisted because UPS International did a horrible job shipping a package from China and it kept being shipped back to China 3 times.  So I let loose on them and they blacklisted me and refuse to deliver my packages to my house, and have them shipped to the UPS Store instead, which is fine. Except NOW, they are not going to deliver it and changed the date when it is already at the destination hub.  I can’t go to the main hub or I will get arrested.  So unnecessarily, I have to wait a day to MAYBE be able to pick it up, if that is even possible now…. It’s a shame it has come to this as I used to really like my UPS in my town.

It was UPS that “delivered” it. By the time I started to wonder when my parcel would be sent (of course I never got a notification from UPS) and went on their website to look up the tracking, the parcel had been returned to the sender. Why, you wonder? Well, that’s a secret they’ll never tell. The parcel travelled from Germany to Sweden, only to be sent back a day later for no reason in particular.

1,UPS Insurance is a Complete Sham,"UPS Insurance is a Complete ShamJune 17 2024 I shipped $7500 of electronic gear from Nashville to Colorado Springs. The coverage was too high, so I settled for $3500, which still cost about $90. I got a brand new Lowes box rated for 80 lbs. The package weight was 74 lbs. I packed the items tightly using peanuts, bubble wrap, and foam. When it was delivered, it was taped up everywhere because it had split wide open; the driver said it was one of the worst jobs of mishandling he’d ever seen. Most of the packing materials were missing. One of the items, worth over $3500, was destroyed so I made a claim for the $3500 coverage (claim number 000-04-553269 - UPS Capital Insurance Agency, Inc 0C47342). I sent as many pictures as the site would allow. It was denied with this disclaimer: “Unfortunately, after a thorough investigation, we are unable to approve the claim because the packaging did not meet UPS standards according to the UPS Tariff/Terms and Conditions.” I appealed and was turned down again with “it does not conform to our guidelines”. So I read their guidelines, and this package checked off every single point. When I explained that they again denied it with “what you have purchased is coverage under the UPS Declared Value program. This is unlike an insurance as you do not have a binding insurance policy.” What???? No further explanation. Being a UPS customer for over 40 years evidently means nothing.

The worts company ever.,2024-09-17 13:43:53,GB
1,They just don’t care !,It’s taken me 5 months in discussion to get a parcel delivered from the USA to England. Still no parcel despite communication with the company.

1,Extremely Lousy Customer Service,Ordered a frozen item thru Costco who used UPS to ship. The item got stuck and UPS never updated delivery schedule. I contacted UPS online and on the phone and could not reach a live person to discuss the huge mistake. Ten days after the item was ordered I still could not get a answer from UPS. Their online info said contact the originating source (Costco). I'm not surprised that Amazon is crushing UPS with this lousy level of customer service. Shame on you UPS.,2024-09-17 02:24:04,US

So I took a precious vacation day, not for a vacation, just looking out the window for a truck.  When I saw the truck pull up I went to the door, waiting for a knock that never came.   The driver just came to the door and stuck a sticker on it, but I chased him down and he looked thoroughly angry that I caught him, didn't say a word to me through the whole process.   Yesterday, my phone died, had 30% charge, and desperately needed a new one to save texts/pictures from 11 years of my life (including deceased loved ones), but didn't know the phone would come UPS.   Who is your target customer.   Who is home and awake at 10 am on weekdays (the only days UPS delivers) to be there to sign.   Worst customer service industry in the country.

1,UPS has three levels of service and they all are horrible,"UPS has three levels of service, AI phone, website, and human phone.  The AI phone system is the worst and I truly believe it was designed to frustrate customers more than to help them.  It is the worst system I have ever experienced.  Ask it to help you place a hold on a package, and it rambles off tracking information unrelated to your request or it will just hang up on you.  It simply is garbage.  Talking to a human if you can actually get one on the phone, is also useless.  You will hear 99% of the time....""My system will not let me.....'enter your problem here' and none of them are based in the US.The website, well, is also garbage.  Makes you sign up for UPS choice to manage your package and then tells you UPS choice does not work with commercial packages.  Why in the world would it tell you to sign up for something if it already knew it would not work with the tracking number (?).  Simply a waste of time and overall bad coding.  Try to sign up for the business equivalent of UPS choice and you get a bunch of website errors and your monitor displays of bunch of random HTML code.  The entire system is garbage, just like the company.  The only good thing I have found about UPS is if you can actually speak with a local location to an actual human in the US. You will find these people will bend over backwards to help you.  It is the only shining point about UPS.  Though good luck trying to navigate the treacherous waters of UPS customer service to actually talk to one of them.  After a few times of doing this myself, it would be more fun to step in front of a moving bus than to put yourself through UPS torture.. cough..... I mean UPS customer service.  I really ...really .... dislike this company to the point where I have started asking whomever I buy from if they use them for logistics.

I had to wait the weekend as well as the following next Monday and Tuesday, finally on Wednesday UPS shows up again and says, this is our final delivery attempt. Are you freaking kidding me! There was NO ATTEMPT TO DELIVER! But wrote us up as people they couldn’t deliver to. Four people were home at the time, six vehicles parked in the yard, two residents and a business building and 3 dogs. If there had been an attempt the whole freaking place would have lit up.

I was then left fighting with the website to try to find the package I ordered. Eventually I called the company, to be greeted by an AI customer service rep. To be thought of as a number not worthy of human contact is simply insulting. I then asked for a real person, once I was on the line with the agent he repeated the script that was word for word from the website and told me that I would have to wait longer for a phone call from the dispatch team to figure out how to deliver my order.

A package that I should have received whitin 2 weeks took over 2 months to get to me. The one language they all understand, both at home and obroad is the threat of a  legal claim against them.

Monday came and I had a notification mid morning that my package had been delivered to a postcode I didn't recognise. So I rang ups again - charged again. And they advised me it had been sent to a locker. I asked how I picked up my parcel as I didn't have a code or qr code and they passed me from department to department and still couldn't provide me with a code. They advised me that I would receive the code in 48 hours.. so my parcel already over a week late.. £600 plus value parcel that I can't collect.. which is for business use which has now put my behind.. and still unresolved.

1,Unacceptable Experience with UPS Alcohol Delivery nted with my…,"I am extremely disappointed with my recent experience with UPS, specifically regarding a package containing alcohol. When the driver arrived, I provided my payroll signature, which I have consistently used when making any alcohol purchases. However, the driver immediately deleted my signature, stating that it was not legible enough because the package contained alcohol. I explained that this was the signature I use for all my alcohol purchases, and that my legal age is determined through my ID, not by the appearance of my signature. Despite this, the driver never once asked to verify my ID to confirm my age.Upon contacting UPS customer service to address the issue, I was told that my signature needed to match the one on my ID. This explanation is not only illogical but also raises serious concerns about UPS’s delivery practices. By this flawed logic, anyone could easily sign for alcohol, including a minor, as long as the signature is deemed “legible.” I questioned how UPS ensures they are not delivering alcohol to underage individuals if they are solely relying on signature legibility instead of proper age verification through ID checks.During my call with customer service, I was assured that someone from my local UPS store would contact me to inform me when the package would be redelivered. Instead, I received the following response:**“GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR REACHING OUT. WE HAVE RECEIVED YOUR CASE INFORMATION AND CONTACTED THE DRIVER REGARDING THIS REFUSED PACKAGE. AFTER TALKING WITH THE DRIVER, WE WERE INFORMED THAT THE PACKAGE WAS ALCOHOL AND YOUR CHOICE OF SIGNATURE WAS NOT VALID FOR THE DRIVER TO RELEASE THE PACKAGE. THIS PACKAGE WILL BE RETURNED TO THE SHIPPER AND YOU MUST CONTACT THEM TO ARRANGE NEW DELIVERY OR REFUND FOR ITEMS. WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE AND WE HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY.”**Not only did the response incorrectly state that I refused the package (which was entirely inaccurate), but it also failed to address the core issue: the driver’s refusal to accept my valid signature without checking my ID. This experience has been frustrating, and the mishandling of my package has been incredibly inconvenient. UPS’s policy and execution are inconsistent, and this incident reflects poorly on their commitment to secure and proper alcohol delivery.I will be sharing my experience across multiple social media platforms to inform others of the poor service and unprofessional behavior exhibited by UPS and their driver. This situation has demonstrated a clear lack of proper training and communication, and I hope that UPS takes immediate action to address these shortcomings to prevent similar issues for other customers in the future.",2024-09-07 10:15:16,US
1,Compulsive liars,"UK to Spain express overnight delivery paid for. Your tracking is utter fabrication. The chronology of events is fanciful at best with statements of where the parcel is is not possible. On 2 telephone calls, which you confirm are recorded, you lie about where the parcel is. You make statements on the phone which are blatant lies. You tell me it's in Germany ,Cologne, and you tracking scans covering the entire time show that it's still in UK. Worse than that, it's been to Stansted and now it's in a coastal town in Essex en route to some other destination perhaps.In your online automated web chat, you make a statement that an operator can only tell me the same as I can see for myself via tracking. This is a clear attempt to avoid any contact with customers. It's also not true as you adviser filled in the gaps with fantasy.You are completely translucent when you should be transparent. By choice I'll not use you service again and I'll ask the company I bought the goods from to not use you.You've cost me time, and money.

Other wise allow customer service to file a claim too. They lost your package and then tell you to contact the sender. UPS is delivering my package not you.

Today at apparently 7:10 pm (delivery by 7:00 pm) the driver came to my door, did not knock or ring the doorbell and left a delivery slip with no information on it, not even the tracking no.

1,"Didn't deliver my parcel, and can't explain why","I posted my parcel - a pair of shoes bought online from an Italian company - using the pro forma shipping invoice forms provided to me by the Italian company and following their instructions to the letter.I dropped the item with UPS on 15th August.It was returned to me on 29th August, with no reason provided. Looking at the item's history online, the reason given was a 'disruption'.I contacted UPS by chat, and the agent first tried to tell me that the item had been returned because the pro forma invoice was illegible. I provided photos of the pro forma invoices, and he agreed that they were, in fact, legible.He then tried to tell me the paperwork must be faulty, and that I just needed to correct it and then reship the item. But he couldn't tell me how exactly it was faulty; and, once I explained that the documentation had been provided by the shipping company who did this sort of return a lot, he caved and agreed that there had been some sort of error on UPS's part - the 'disruption'.The returns window was 14 days. UPS had the parcel for that entire time, and I am not sure now whether the sender will accept the return. Plus, do I want the hassle of having to deal with UPS again?No apology, no compensation, just resend it and sort the mess UPS created out with the sender.",2024-08-30 13:16:48,GB

I can't get through to a real person because the system is set up to hang up on you and verbally refuses to let you talk a representative, while pretending it's hard of hearing even if you YELL the tracking number. I paid $20 for their premium address change service only to be told my mailing address is a business, so no (you're right, they sell mail services! Not my real address. This is true for a lot of people in Alaska.). The shipper is having to refund me because of UPS incompetence. And UPS refuses to give me my $20 back. I tried to get a supervisor on the phone, but they just transferred me to another agent that was playing pretend supervisor. Now I'm on hold with billing. Billing doesn't know why they transferred me. I don't really know, either. I'm pretty sure I just got punked by this so called supervisor. They definitely like to leave you on hold for an hour with no refreshes like phone agents are supposed to do. So, the conclusion: I'm not getting a refund. Since their system is working just fine on their end (their assumption), they don't care if it's messing up on the shipper or customer's end. They see no reason to report a bug in the system at all. Everything is fine for them, so everything should be fine for you. Goodbye. This literally took me an entire day.UPS is definitely not a good shipper if you live in Alaska. Use Fedex or USPS. Fedex actually developed an entirely new system of procedures, services, and pricing just for Alaska. They adapted to us. USPS adapted their system to us a long time ago. Example, we are allowed to receive shipments to P.O. boxes. We can even ship frozen fish with ease - Fedex went so far as to provide the boxes and freezer for it. And we can reroute a shipment to a Fedex Office as a HAL at any point before it's delivered.",2024-08-29 21:31:47,US

B.S. 08.29 and no updates / movementWhile the staff at the Parrish UPS store is friendly and accommodating, the overall performance of UPS as an international logistics company absolutely beyond poor.Instead of telling a customer at time of accepting & preparing items (in my case 15lbs bag of clothing - luggage, for which I gave employee a detailed, each line item pack list) for shipping, what documents and info are needed, you pay a huge amount (close to $900 for 15 lbs to Germany) for Express Shipping (was told only option) only to learn that your shipment is being held up indefinitely by UPS brokers/Customs overseas due to missing documents and information, you were never told you needed ? First, US based Phone Number not accepted? Need to provide Destination country Number,  need copy of Passport & Flight Itinerary (while it may make sense), it causes unnecessary and frustrating delays, because of UPS failure to communicate rules properly, effectively. Initially  I was repeatedly told ""no problem with shipment"". Only, after sending email in German, to some UPS international email in Germany, did I slowly get responses and was informed of missing documents for processing/release.I thought shipping luggage ahead of time would ease stress at airport? For that amount of money, I could have shopped for clothes over there and spared myself a lot of time & aggravating back and forth emails, calls. I guess dealing with airline luggage issues is maybe still a better option?Note: Local employees consult with and follow instructions of UPS international shipping group, who is squarely to blame for all delays and mishaps, while customer is at local store. There is a lot of room for improvement to say the least. Not a reliable carrier & definitely NOT EFFICIENT. UPS international is not doing local UPS Store owners any favors by upsetting and alienating customers. Whether shipment ever reaches its final delivery destination remains to be seen? Package was given to UPS store/sent on 08.13.24 and orig. delivery date given by local UPS, was 08.19.24. Per UPS track number extensive import / warehouse scan history, package arrived in Germany in UPS warehouse in Ķöln on 08.15.24. On 08.16. Was told German phone number was needed (given US number insufficient), which was immediately provided. No mention ever of missing passport or flight itinerary? I repeatedly asked verbally and in emails (in English and German) whether there is a specific issue/reason that is holding up delivery.  Nothing ref. missing documents was ever said/relayed until 08.25.24? All required/requested info was instantly provided. The handling of this shipment/matter by UPS is simply inexcusable, unprofessional.

I asked for the parcel to be dropped off in Athabasca, at the Ups access point. She faught with me and said there wasn't one there, but the parcel will show up at my house. The change in address would take up to 3 bussiness days. I also had to pay another fee to have this address changed. I was doing everything in my ginger power to refrain from loosing my cool on the phone. 3 days pass and I see on their website, my address is wrong!!!!! Like how the h*** do you mess this up, considering we went over it how many times on the phone. So I call back to correct it again. This parcel is should have been delivered on August 13th. When I spoke to this other gentlemen, I explain the situation, and asked again for it to be delivered to the Ups access point in Athabasca. I honestly felt it would not be delivered to the country side. He assured me it would. I asked to speak to a supervisor, who could speak fluent English, and he would not transfer me over. He told me if I wanted to make another address change I would be charged for that again. Once again these changes would take up to 3 bussiness days. From here my temper escalated and I told him, I'm positive my parcel will not be delivered to my home in the country. Can we please just do the access point in Athabasca for it. He again replied this would be another charge for the change, but nothing is in his system for Athabasca. I was so frustrated with him. I said, so what happens when this parcel doesn't show up? He said to call them back. I have been watching their web page for well over a week now, with no change in delivery status. So, I changed the delivery address to - guess where?!?!?! The access point for ups in Athabasca, which they both told le doesn't exist. I know damn well this access point exists because I have had to use it for bussiness purposes. We are now on August 23, and still no change in the delivery date, no parcel in hand, and all I have noticed is how incompetent these employees truly are. I have paid more fees for this package than I ever should have. How the hell do they stay running??? My change in address to the nearest Ups access point is stuck in a ""pending"" status. This parcel is somewhere between Edmonton and Athabasca. I even told these guys to tell their drivers to just drop the damn package off in edmonton and I'll get it when I'm there next. But no, they can't do that they said. Yet on their website, it clearly states that when I changed the delivery address to the ups access point, it would notify the driver right away on their handheld computer. So don't tell me again, you can communicate with you're ups drivers when it comes to the parcels they are transporting!!! I just want my damn package 📦. I'll never use, or recommend this transportation company again.",2024-08-23 16:10:56,CA
1,Final straw for me using ups,"Most companies I purchase from don’t use UPS. But on the few times that UPS do deliver to me it’s always the same.yesterday I get a 4 hour window ( 9.30-1.30). By 2pm this then changed to end of the day ( which looks to be 7pm).  By 11pm this is amended to delivery details will follow. Today we are following the same path and from previous experience I don’t expect the delivery to come. That will be 2 full days hanging around for them. Don’t want to leave in a safe space as it a big expensive parcel. There is no way to track like there is with their competitors who are far better. To complain I have to register an account read a massive list of terms and conditions that waivers their liability in their duty to their customers, which doesn’t bode well for how they will deal with my complaint. I will be canceling my order with the supplier and use another company that does not deliver through UPS as this is the same every time with this Mickey Mouse company !!! without fail.",2024-08-23 14:51:59,GB

And if I try to contact them about the issues, it directs me to a virtual chat, instead of a real person, and ends up being a complete waste of time that accomplishes nothing.

I've had a package sitting there in the warehouse for 24hrs that was supposed to be delivered today  and no one can tell me what's going on.At one point I was told the package was at a location for pick up. Put down the phone call back and the package is miraculously back in the warehouse. Truely frustrating",2024-08-14 22:45:07,CA

I get texts saying it’s out for delivery + it will come later but when you decide it’s not coming until the next day there is zero notification you get to know this information unless you’re actively watching the tracking. 2 hours after they’ve cancelled my delivery today I’m still here waiting because they never notified me. 2 deliveries, not delivered despite being ‘out for delivery’ Using ups genuinely makes me super uncomfortable which is crazy considering it’s a delivery company.",2024-08-14 19:57:08,GB

I live in an apartment, they knock on the complex door instead of ringing the door bell! I even left a note! He took off with the package with no indication as to where my package would be!

5,This review is for drivers not the CEO,"This review is for drivers not the CEO. If I would have to grade the company admins, it'd be an F-.It's the drivers and managers at the warehouse facilities who make this company. I had a few issues with my delivery due to a signature requirement. Called my local UPS store, to ask if I can pick up my package there. Apparently UPS stores are 3rd party business and not part of UPS (huh? um ok).Then the real nightmare started. Wow is that AI system horrible. If UPS and their terrible CEO want to destroy their company and reputation, have at it, but if you want to keep and build your customer base, maybe get rid of that horrible, condescending and incapable AI customer service. I was not upset about my package at all, but wow, your AI machine really cracked open my annoyance for the day. Newsflash, people want to talk to real people, not machines. I get it if you have an easy to answer question that should be rerouted, but if your question is complex, good luck. That machine doesn't even understand the 10 mile long UPS number, and if you get really lucky, it just hangs up on you.When you finally break through this wall, you get connected with very friendly, but very far away (from USA grounds) customer service representatives. To fix your issue, the very friendly, but very far away people then have to call the warehouse in the US, to understand what the issue was and to find a remedy. Efficiency? Nope, saving money. It's disgusting how outsourcing is just blatant money saving, devaluing the people who have to listen to annoyed customers all day. I hope one day you get the compensation you deserve.The far away representatives promised someone would call me within an hour. That did not happen. Called again (another 10 min to break through the wall of the Stepford wives), was promised another call within an hour. That also didn't happen, but it was already past 7 PM, so I didn't expect anything to happen. The very far away representatives are probably dealing with a time change that makes it hard to address things in the US, so I don't blame them.Got the call from the warehouse manager. Very friendly and helpful. He offered a few options, one of which was to check with the local UPS store if they'd take the package so I could pick it up. Nope they won't (cause remember, 3rd party service). The awesome drive then checked with my apartment manager who was so kind to sign it on my behalf.Just wanted to leave an A+++ for the awesome customer service of the real people I talked to and the drivers and managers who probably work their asses off to keep this company rolling.Reading Reddit UPS posts really opened my eyes. Everyone's being outsourced to save a few bucks, so that the CEO can claim she's made this company profitable for the investors. For how long? I smell another Stockmarket crash, because really, how long can you keep cutting positions? It is mind boggling. Profit over people will only last you for so long. We're social animals, and we don't want to talk to machines. People who are valued work harder, just an fyi to the incredible incapable CEO and her army of terrible decision makers.",2024-08-14 03:21:22,US

1,"UPS is horrendous, especially Saturday delivery drivers!","I tried to get a car seat delivered through UPS. This was a present from my babyshower. We live in an appartment complex with a mail room which can be accessed Monday through Friday by delivery drivers. Saturday the building is closed to the public. The car seat was delivered on a Saturday. We were out of town and I had a big sign on my door that they please should not drop off packages outside my door since we are out of town. The normal thing to do would have been to deliver the car seat on Monday to the mail room since obviously nobody was home. What did UPS do? They dropped off the almost 600 dollar car seat outside of my door. What was the result? It got stolen, pending police investigation. We complained and the company delivered another car seat through UPS. This time we were at home. The delivery was also on a Saturday. We were able to follow the delivery driver on a map. The scheduled delivery was between 10:15am and 12:15pm. This time frame got more and more delayed. In the end the car seat was supposed to be delivered &quot;before 7pm that day&quot;. We stayed home all day since the first car seat was stolen and we did not want to risk that anything happens to the package again. Around 5pm the driver was finally in our area. My husband went outside to look for the truck. A minute later I got the notification online that the delivery was attempted, but nobody was home and that they would try again on Monday. The map to follow the truck was also not available any more. After waiting all day for this delivery, we got nothing. We tried calling UPS, but they just said that the driver has off now and they would try again on the following Monday. We explained that I am pregnant and that I cannot lift the car seat package of 20 pounds and bring it from the mail room to my appartment and that my husband is working until late. We were asking them to please deliver the package to our door on Monday since it got stolen before and even the mail room was not a safe place. UPS did not deliver to our door, even after all the hassle. On top of that the package was damaged on 2 sides and now the car seat has a few scratches. This one delivery resulted in weeks full of hassle, extra time spent on our end (police report, calls to the car seat company, calls to UPS etc), all things that could have been avoided by UPS.",2024-08-13 22:20:09,US

1,"UPS Store #2788, Virginia Beach, Va","UPS Store #2788, 1340 N Great Neck Rd Suite 1272, Virginia Beach, VaThis review is also going to UPS Corporate.Today, July 6, at 12:23 PM I brought in an Amazon return package that was required to be sent via an official UPS store. Although I’ve read many negative reviews, I’ve had good service from this location for many years, but what happened today was so disgusting that my rating has gone, in one trip, from a 5 star to a 1 star.I’m 75 years old and was struggling to unload from my truck bed and carry this very large box (containing a collapsible wheel chair) weighing approximately 50 lb. When I got to the store’s double door entry which only opens to the outside, I could not hold the box and open the door at the same time, so I propped the box up against the left side door, the one that’s usually, for many businesses, not even unlocked. I held it there with one hand and my knee. I opened the right side door, re-established my grip on the box, and entered the store. If I had placed the box on the ground to open the door, I would’ve had a very difficult time lifting it up again. There was no one around that I could’ve asked to open the door for me. There was no one exiting the store.The worker and I were the only 2 people in the store. I greeted the man with “Hi, how you doing today?” His response was “I would be doing OK if you’d not tried to break my door!” To which I respectfully responded “I was having a problem getting my box in. I always wonder why stores like this don’t have doors that swing both ways.” I don’t recall his exact words, but after he threw my receipt at me, he rudely left the conversation by walking into the back room, and said on the way something about me “not having the intelligence to correctly open the door.” After he insulted me, I then stated “Now I see why this store has so many negative reviews” to which he responded from the back room. Don’t remember exact words, but they included “Get Out!”FYI, there was absolutely no abuse, much less damage, to the left side door or its mechanism. When I propped the box, there was a minor noise when the door set firmly against its latching /locking mechanism.I have ID’ed the time of drop off in case anyone associated with this store wants to know who this extremely rude employee or owner was. As far as I could see he was the only worker there at this time. He was a little on the short side, just slightly heavy, with a small black beard/ goatee. I suspect, from reading other reviews, that he could have been Joe.This store is only about 5 minutes from my home, much closer than the others in town. So, I intend to go there again when I need to, which thankfully, is not very often. One more episode like this and they will never see me again.",2024-08-12 19:26:38,US

My window faces the road where delivery trucks drive and I can hear knocking on the door if someone knocks.

Now, because of their incompetence, a one of kind non-replacable item is in some else's procession. I contacted UPS to complain, but all they did was apologize & opened an investigation to retrieve the package. But that is not going to work, because the package is another party's procession. Obviously, errors happen, but I receive numerous packages & many from UPS & they make it to the correct address without issue. So, it appears that UPS, does not hold their drivers accountable for wrong deliveries at a measure that sways their drivers to ACCURATELY read the label & deliver to the CORRECT address. Instead, they tell you that they can refund the shipper so as to refund you. The purpose of an order is to have it delivered, correctly, therefore an incorrect delivery does not meet that minimum standard, a correct delivery. When a driver delivers to a wrong address, that driver should be retained & all drivers measured for accuracy & failing means termination & accuracy is rewarded.",2024-08-08 13:22:37,US

Year old had to go out inbfoul weather to retrieve it. Had to sent something back to my employer, a fairly big and known company in the region of Asturias, and they said they couldn't find the address.. Latest issue is me ordering live plants from a company in Italy, and they refuse to deliver to my address, even though they have delivered to that address twice before, this time my name was not correct (shocker, it was spelled correctly, just not Spanish), the excuse was that when they arrived on the location, no-one knew me... They could've rang my phone but refused, and I wasn't under the impression that everyone has to know me. After some emailing, indicating they had delivered here before, they ordered a new attempt, where they beelined to a parcel pickup point,  as on both attempts they haven't even driven by. On the box it said that no alternative phone number was available, don't know why multiple phone numbers should be given as they don't even bother using the one given (UPS, mobile phones have caller ID and memory, I can prove that both times I wasn't called).

When he didn’t I phoned back and was told the driver hadn’t been able to get in contact with me. He actually hadn’t tried. I phoned again an hour later to be told they couldn’t contact the driver. A manager phoned me approximately 15mins later and said she would check it out and phone me back. This didn’t happen. Shortly afterward I got a call from Donal saying the driver had an incident and my parcel would not be delivered until after the weekend between 7am and 7pm and they couldn’t give a tighter window. Eventually my parcel arrived today. The driver apologized for the delay explaining that he had told his manager that he would be finishing at 12 last Friday and would be taking the undelivered parcels with him to Monaghan. He said he gave his manager 2 weeks notice. This explains the so called incident and updated incomplete delivery address.

I placed my order Thursday afternoon and it was despatched and on the way to me for Friday delivery. I should say at this point that I am an 80 year old female and not in the best of health so home deliveries are important to me. I waited and watched from my downstairs window overlooking my drive whilst browsing online to pass the time.  I have a doorbell and a door knocker and all the windows were open on a hot day.There was no UPS van or driver on foot that came to my house by lunchtime so I joined the UPS app to find out my parcel's progress. This showed that the delivery driver had filed to say that the delivery had been attempted and that my package would be delivered to the nearest ""hub"". No delivery had been attempted so this was not the truth. I complained to UPS but they would not believe me that the driver most definitely did not attempt delivery. No show, no card. UPS customer services are most unhelpful and disbelieving. The UPS website says this. UPS InfoNotice®Sorry, we missed you. Your driver left a UPS InfoNotice because their first attempt at delivering or collecting your parcel was unsuccessful.I have informed Canon customer services of the appalling service received by UPS.",2024-08-03 14:09:54,GB

And did they fix the problem?? Absolutely not. I had gotten one answer from a manager in the morning, and a different answer in the afternoon from a different manager. The delivery driver thought it was appropriate to walk around my house instead of just staying at the front of my house. There was Zero need for him to go looking on the sides of my house and thank goodness I have cameras so that I have the backup proof that I need when I report them to the necessary agencies. I have a lot more I can say but I think I'll save it for the Better Business Bureau and other agencies that I'm reporting them to. I asked them for a solution to the problems, they didn't have one solution. They sure did have a lot of blankets statements such as ""I'm sorry"" or ""I understand"", however we all know that they do not. And whoever trained them in that poor shoddy customer service training should be fired. Because those statements just upset people more than they ever help. I've made it clear to you ups that I do not wish to have any business with them further and they are not allowed on my property. And anyone that deals with them I won't be dealing with.

Suddenly, the live tracking got switched off and I got a message from UPS they couldn't locate the package anymore. The delivery address also changed to some random UPS access point that isn't even that close to me and I've not authorised at all. Guess what? Now I have to walk for quite a while in this heat to go get my package from this random access point after having paid for door-to-door delivery. The reason? Driver is so incompetent that he couldn't make it to my address on time and decided to just go to his nearest drop off point, without bothering to check whether it is near for me too. Absolute rubbish, companies like this one should be taken out of business for their absolute lack of professionalism and obnoxious customer service.

Recently, I have experienced multiple instances where my packages were delivered to the wrong address. Despite having clear delivery instructions and a properly labeled address, the driver consistently leaves my items at the wrong location. This has caused significant inconvenience and frustration, as I have had to track down my packages each time.I always file claims, and my poor supplier has to pay for the lost items because of this sorry company and their useless driver. UPS has a terrible app and website that are incredibly difficult to use, leading to even more frustration when trying to resolve issues. Attempting to call their customer service takes you nowhere and doesn’t help resolve the problems.I expect better from a reputable company like UPS. This lack of attention to detail and care in handling deliveries is unacceptable.

First delivery window came and went that got the message, ""driver was not able to receive payment"" despite no driver ever arriving (porch cam to prove it). Called customer service and got through ok and they were quite nice and said that they would make sure it was delivered the next day - tracking info agreed. Window came and went - no package - and again ""driver was not able..."". Contacted CS again and only then did they claim the duties had to be prepaid on line - I pointed out that there was no reason for me to trust them at this point so was not going to pay in advance. Was promised a call back from dispatch to address the issue or order would be cancelled with vendor. No call came. Called third time suggesting that they drop at a UPS store and I can pay there. CS first said, nope, we won't drop there until you prepay. Told them once again I would cancel order and ""surprise"" oh, okay you can pay there. I still needed assistance to set that up and demanded a call from dispatcher within hour. Never happened.

This alone is unacceptable, but the ordeal didn't end there. Thankfully, the seller agreed to send my package again. However, UPS decided to torment me further with their sheer incompetence.For four consecutive days, I received false notifications about delivery attempts. Each day, I rescheduled my plans, ensuring I was home to receive the package. Each day, no one showed up. It's as if UPS gets some perverse pleasure out of misleading their customers. The customer service agents, whom I had the misfortune of speaking to, are some of the most incompetent people I have ever encountered. They provided no help and seemed utterly clueless about their own processes.Frustrated beyond measure, I agreed to drive to Richmond, a 30-minute drive from my home, to pick up my package. I was explicitly told by a customer service agent that my package was being held at this center. But upon arriving, I was informed that my package was with the driver. I had to return home empty-handed, wasting my time and fuel for nothing.Why would any person with integrity associate themselves with this institution is beyond me. UPS should be ashamed of themselves. Their lack of professionalism and utter disregard for their customers is appalling.",2024-07-24 01:28:12,CA

The emails, the estimates, the pricing, the receipt, the customer support, NOTHING WORKS in this company. I can hardly believe they still make money. UPS, or OOPS, as it should be called given the amount of mistakes they make, is the definition of incompetence. 0 stars. Stay away from this garbage company.",2024-07-23 14:52:46,PT

1,UPS CUSTOMER SERVICE = DOGSH!T,"After struggling with a lost package for over a month, trying every day to reach any human being at UPS... IMPOSSIBLE!!!UPS now represents the absolute worst delivery service of all time. They don't even offer anyone a working number. When you call any one of the UPS numbers, they are all programed to prevent us from speaking to a representative. I don't see any way in the world this company can get back to functioning as we all remember. I URGE EVERYONE OF SOUND MIND TO AVOID ANY DOING BUSINESS WITH UPS, ITS NOT HEALTHY FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH. As far as I'm concerned, there should be a federal investigation into how PATHETIC this company can continue to FAIL in almost every way possible, all because they feel they are now too big to fail. Still won't share any details of a package lost in mid June. SMART MONEY WILL SHORT THIS P.O.S. until there's nothing left. They don't try to make things better, so let's help them get the hell out of the way so we don't have to endure the worst shipping service of ALL-TIME!R.I.P. UPS. They have a ZERO chance of surviving, mainly because AMAZON taught both FEDEX AND UPS how to take over the delivery business. And for the record, AMAZON is a far superior DELIVERY service and UPS should be forced to have their senior management learn a few things from them.",2024-07-23 23:09:04,US

1,If it were at all possible to leave…,If it were at all possible to leave zero stars believe me I would. I was sent a medical device from medtronic that required a signature.  One time there was a sticker left on my door saying sorry we missed you . Not sure how when there is someone at my home 24/7 but ok then for 2 weeks I keep getting the same sticker left on my mailbox and several of theese days I the recipient was home all day waiting on this package no one came up my driveway just kept putting the sticker on the mailbox I have a long driveway there is no way for me to see when ups pulls up to my mailbox and when you get a estimated delivery time from 10a.m to 3:45pm I can't sit at the bottom of my driveway for over 5 hours so how am I supposed to sign for this package? Let me remind you this is a medical device I'm waiting on . Then after multiple attempts just to get a customer service rep on the phone to try and address this issue all she does is keep repeating to call the sender so I respond the issue is not the sender the issue is your ups driver not doing their job and driving up my driveway and knocking on the door. Unfortunately the customer service is just as bad as the driver nothing was done they are sending the package back to the sender so even if they send it again being that it's a medical device it will still require a signature so I will still be having the same issue unless I wanna camp out by mail box for 5 hours or drive an hour to the closest ups facility.  Needless to say I will never use ups for anything personally and looking like medtronic is going to lose customers too unless they can use a better delivery service . What worries me the most is how many elderly people out there are not getting important packages because ups is lazy and not made to do their job . Seriously ups! Do better!,2024-07-23 02:07:24,US

That alone doesn’t make sense since the package could get delivered before they have your set instructions. I had got an email saying that my package was not able to deliver and that I have to go pick it up somewhere. I do not drive and I had ordered a large fan. How is this convenient? I have never had this experience with any other carrier company. UPS could not tell me why they sent to a pickup location all they said was you have to go pick it up or it will be sent back to amazons warehouse.

1,UPS Threw Away My Parcle!,"UPS does not put the customer at the forefront of its business model. I mailed an item and when it did not arrive at the destination followed up with the UPS store I sent it from. I was informed that my package had been thrown away because it had been rolled over. Now this would normally be understandable except it was a FLAT piece of material! A tent rainfly to be exact.Unfortunately, this occurred while I was out of the country and I did not receive any messages from UPS when I returned. The UPS store said there was nothing they could do and told me to call the main UPS number. After being hung up on and disconnected twice, I finally reached a UPS representative who told me there was nothing they could do and told me to contact the UPS store I had mailed the package from. I don't think I need to explain the INFURIATING circle of crap I was then placed in. All said and done, I was not refunded, my property was thrown away, no one called to follow up after I answered their dumb survey questions, and I wasn't provided with anything more than ""There's nothing we can do for you.""",2024-07-22 19:29:47,US

1,Don't Bother Rescheduling Your Package,"The estimated delivery date for my package was Wednesday, July 17th. The delivery window was something like 10am-1pm, which was perfect. 1:30 comes, no package and I need to leave. The contents of the package are food items that would spoil if left outside during 95 degree weather for hours, so I logged into my UPS account and paid $9.99 to reschedule my delivery date. I chose Saturday the 20th, as I’d be home that entire day, and it was soon confirmed to be the new delivery date. Was the package delivered then?? NOPE! I contacted customer service around 6pm on Saturday and spoke to an outsourced customer service rep who barely spoke English and didn’t seem to understand my issue. Asked for a refund, as I paid for a definitive service that I did not receive, and they acted like that was the craziest request in the world. Was told I’d be getting a call back from the warehouse within the hour so they could discuss with me what happened to my package. Did that happen?? NOPE! It’s now Monday, the 22nd, and after basically giving up any hope that I would finally receive this package, it was mysteriously delivered at 10:50am. Luckily I was still home to hear the delivery person literally throw my package…yards away from my front door. Thanks…so much.",2024-07-22 17:28:22,US

On a clear day with no traffic.So you fail to schedule enough employees to meet your arrangements. I'll also take this to the BBB since it feels like UPS doesn't actually care to make right what they do wrong.

Because I'm staying at a friend for a week and I'm having an Amazon package delivered to my friend's address. But the dimwitted UPS driver refused to deliver the package because... my name is not in the building directory.Of course it isn't! That's why I had put my friend's name as well in the address, but that apparently resulted in an ""invalid address exception"" that I had to correct on their site. Which I did. The next day - the same issue: package not delivered due to an address problem.Thing is, Amazon has my phone number on record, yet the driver NEVER CALLED ME so I could go meet them and sign for the damn package!So I'm on hold with support as I'm typing this review, trying to get them to drop the package at some UPS Access Point that I could pick it up from.

1,Consistently Failing to Deliver…,"I have been dealing with UPS for package deliveries this year, and I am extremely dissatisfied with their service. Here are the issues we've encountered on at least ten different occasions: Repeated Failure to Deliver on Time: UPS has consistently failed to deliver our packages on time. This has caused us significant inconvenience, especially when we have critical deadlines for projects and events.False Claims by the Fort Smith, AR Driver: We have caught the driver on camera several times falsely claiming that he attempted delivery. He has marked packages as requiring a signature and left notices without ever stepping out of his vehicle. On one occasion, he placed a notice on our travel trailer parked in front of the house, claiming he was afraid of our dogs, who were inside the house.Lack of Accountability: Despite numerous complaints, the local UPS center has shown a complete lack of concern. They refuse to escalate the matter to the center supervisor, even though this driver has a history of complaints.Discrimination Against Rural Areas: It is clear that UPS does not prioritize customers in rural areas. We are just 9 miles past two towns with over 110k people, yet we are treated as a low priority. FedEx and other vendors manage to deliver to us without any issues, proving that our location is not the problem.Overall, UPS's service has been abysmal, and their lack of response to our complaints shows that they do not care about their customers.

I will remove it once the problem is resolved.When calling customer service at 1-800-782-7892 or 1-888-742-5877, the automated system asks for a tracking number.

This prevents me from ever speaking to a human representative.In today's world, improving customer service is crucial for business growth. If UPS cannot resolve customer issues, people will turn to competitors, resulting in a loss of market share. I am very frustrated with the numerous calls where I couldn't speak to a real person, which wasted a lot of my time.

1,Shipping & Mailing Internationally to Mexico,"I needed to mail an unactivated debit card from the US to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The 1st attempt to mail the card was via UPS on 6/22/24 from Seneca SC to Puerto Vallarta Mexico. The card goes from Anderson to West Colombia to Jackson MS to Shreveport, LA to Arlington, TX. I am saying well eventually.  It arrives to a ""facility"" in Mexico on 6/28 and sits there until 7/2/ before being returned to the US without any notification to me other than seeing the information in tracking.  After my initial complaint to the local UPS location from where it was originally sent in Seneca SC, they produced an internal document attached here showing mailing a debit card/credit card was prohibited despite the information in the document not being available pubicly beforehand and saying they could not refund the wasted $96 USD and could not possibly be expected to be responsible to all the places to where they ship. So the original card arrived back to my US address 7/15/22 after paying $96.00. So almost 23 days later finally got the bank card bank....Card sent via Fed EX 7/15 at a cost of 65 USD and the card safely arrives in PV 7/17...in 2 days at a substantial reduced cost.... UPS you better get back to delivery of products if you expect to stay in business...I for one will not be using your services again...",2024-07-18 00:02:08,MX
1,#### Complaint about Delivery…,"#### Complaint about Delivery Experience**Summary:**The delivery man arrived with parcels, one of which had a £30 duty to be paid. However, he insisted on cash payment and could not accept card. As I didn't have cash at home and the office closed at 2pm, I couldn't pay by phone. Consequently, he took both parcels away, leaving me no option to pay. Subsequently, I received an email stating that one parcel was not delivered, while the other one was. This experience was very unprofessional, and I found it frustrating that the option to pay online was not communicated to me by the driver.**Details:**The delivery man brought parcels, one of which required a £30 duty payment in cash. Despite my lack of cash at home and the closure of the office at 2pm, the delivery man refused card payment and suggested I pay by phone. However, due to the time, I couldn't pay by phone as the office had already closed. As a result, he took both parcels away, leaving me unable to pay for the duty.Later, I received an email stating that one parcel was not delivered, while the other one was. This experience left me feeling very frustrated and disappointed with the unprofessionalism of the delivery service. Upon attempting to pay online, I found it to be a much more convenient option than paying by phone. It's perplexing why the driver did not inform me of this method, which could have resolved the issue immediately. As a result of this experience, I strongly advise others to avoid this delivery company and consider using alternative services to avoid similar stressful situations.**Conclusion:**I am now faced with the task of tracking down the delivered parcel that was never left, which has left me feeling absolutely furious about the entire experience.",2024-07-17 23:57:20,GB

1,UPS Don't Deliver and Leadership Don't Care.,"Update: The United States Post Office had and delivered my package.UPS has given me every right to believe that their drivers are stealing packages, and telling the office that the package has been delivered.... UPS has delivered my package EVERYWHERE ELSE but to me. This is not the first time, I had this problem with UPS. And If I had known, that the Seller was going to use UPS, I would not have purchased the item, because I never get my packages (with the exception of one time, when I contacted Headquarters).... Today UPS documented that my package was delivered and left at the Post Office, the Post Office didn't have the package. So where's my package (rhetorical)??? UPS have supposedly left my package twice, with people in my building who I don't know, and I never received those packages. The one time that I did receive the package (after complaining to headquarters), I caught the driver/deliverer ""still"" handing off my package to the person next door in my building (he rang her door bell and not mine- the package had my apt #). When the person next door realized that I was standing at my door (I saw the UPS truck outside, Headquarters told me that the driver was histhe way, so I knew he had my package,with my apt. #) she looked at the package and gave me the package. So, fast forward to today. I go to the post office and they received no package from UPS with my name. I immediately contacted the seller to let them know that I didn't receive the package, neither do the Post Office have the package. Next Steps...First, I'm grateful for platforms like Trustpilot which allows transparency (positive or negative) for companies such as UPS...but this is not enough, complaining gets nothing done... Clearly UPS has yet to correct their drivers/delivers' actions, in my case and most likely in others. So, it's time to see if I have enough solid evidence to start a class action law suit. For legal purposes, it's comforting to see, that I am not the only customer who have been scammed by UPS..... So many customers repeatedly have had the same issues, and still nothing changed. We may have a case.",2024-07-18 04:05:15,US

Despite discussing the request in person, emailing the document, and receiving confirmation that they could print the 12 pages, I was shocked to find out that they hadn't even started the printing process after waiting for one and a half days.

They were able to print the document in less than 30 seconds and provided excellent service.

UPS lost a crucial document I urgently needed, and they're unable to locate it. They haven't bothered to provide any updates on my package either. Moreover, none of the phone numbers they list, or those found online, are operational.

1,Do not use UPS!,"I work in shipping and Receiving at a local company in Vancouver Canada.  I want to be clear that I am not writing this out of anger or rage; I am writing this to warn others who are trying to decide on a courier to use for business, personal, or other.Out of every courier I deal with on a daily basis (we work with FedEx, UPS, CanadaPost, Amazon, DHL, K&H, AirNorth, and several local couriers), UPS is absolutely the sloppiest, most careless and rude company out of them all.  It's a rare occurrence for our UPS packages to arrive unharmed in some way.  Whether the drivers drop them on the concrete floor of our warehouse and leave without a word, or there is one (or more) huge gash(es) in the cardboard, there is frequent damage to the goods.  As of today (July 10th, 2024), we were informed that UPS damaged our parcel beyond repair and discarded the package, with no refund or compensation for the crime. Another example is when a driver came to pick up a parcel we were shipping to the USA, and claimed we had the wrong paperwork for the item.  This was a rush order that needed to be delivered in 1 business day, so it was very expensive to ship.  He took our 3 commercial invoices out of the package and said they weren't needed.  This package was then reported as lost due to lack of proper paperwork.  The driver claimed 0 responsibility and said we should've had 3 commercial invoices next time we saw him.  It honestly astounds me that a company like this is as popular as they are.  If you're shipping a cheap item that you couldn't care less about, only then would I say that UPS is a safe bet, although their rates are higher than other couriers we use (such as FedEx).  Choosing UPS is a certain recipe for disaster.",2024-07-10 19:46:02,CA

1,I was waiting for 2 parcels from Cruise…,"I was waiting for 2 parcels from Cruise Fashion. They use DPD, which use UPS for shipping. Both parcels were at a drop-off point on July 3rd and when I went to pick them up on July 6th, they had disappeared and nobody knew where they were. Turned out a UPS driver had mistakenly taken them and returned them to UPS. After that I had to phone UPS 6 times on Monday to ask that they deliver the parcels to my house. They delivered one parcel yesterday and the other one went missing. UPS said they had the other one and they would deliver it today. This morning, tracking indicated that someone had requested a delivery reschedule and they would deliver on Friday. Who asked for that reschedule??? Nobody knows! I won't be home tomorrow and I'm leaving on Friday, so I asked a delivery for today.They said they would arrange it and someone would call me within an hour. Nobody called. I called back. They said that since someone (a mysterious entity, not me that's for sure!) had requested a delivery reschedule , it would take 48 hours to process the parcel.They suggested that I go myself to the other end of town, over one hour away, 2 hours or more at rush hour to pick-up the parcel at their warehouse. I have no other choice but to do that. But of course, things are not that easy: I have to wait 2 hours for a confirmation that the parcel is ready to pick-up. But guess what is even worse: I just tracked my parcel again and... now delivery has been rescheduled to July 19th!!!  Hahaha! When and how will this end? Is there a ghost in UPS's system? Are they hacked? Those mysterious delivery change requests keep appearing and nobody at UPS is able to tell me who makes them. I have been keeping Cruise Fashion updated about each step of this saga and all they did was to tell me that they were sorry and that they would notify DPD (the broker between them and UPS). I am beside myself with frustration. It's the worst experience I have ever had with shipping, by very far. The only other terrible experience I had was also with UPS. They lost a parcel and it was recovered several months later at their warehouse... Bravo UPS! Keep up the good work!",2024-07-10 16:57:51,CA

1,Wish I could give zero stars,"Wish I could give zero stars. I have a package being delivered via UPS that needs a signature. The initial tracking said that it would be here on Tuesday. When I arrived home Monday evening, there was a notification on my door that I had missed the delivery attempt but they would try again tomorrow. Ok. When tomorrow arrived, I checked the tracking and it said it would be delivered between 230 and 4:30 PM, I work and I had to make arrangements to be home during That timeframe, So I could sign for my package. I checked the tracking later and it had changed to between 4:45 PM and 8:30 PM. I made new arrangements to be home during that time frame. When I arrived home at 4:30 there was a notification on my door that they had come at 3 PM to attempt my delivery!!!! Far outside their delivery window! I called and spoke with Ken and he was amazing and put in an urgent message for the dispatcher to call me. When the dispatch manager George called me, he promptly hung up on me because he thought I should accept his excuse that that’s just an estimated timeframe. Your whole existence is around the delivery of packages. Your timeframe is YOUR JOB! literally, what are you doing??? Because you’re not delivering packages, which is your whole business model. I am also in the business of customer service and sales and I would never, NEVER treat any customer the way I was treated today by UPS by multiple different employees, which tells me this is acceptable to UPS. I have requested that they allow me to pick up my package instead because they cannot do their job, but it’s been 30 minutes and I’ve not heard back from them. So maybe passive aggressively not going to deliver my package to me? Is that where we are? Kind of seems that way. The representatives from UPS that I spoke with multiple, besides Ken who was amazing, all were awful!! They had zero customer service skills, had zero empathy. You told me you would be delivering my packages that I have to sign for, during a certain time. I then had no choice but to plan my day around that, and then you did not deliver what you said. That is your whole business. And then your employees spoke to me like it was just a normal thing to not deliver packages as they should be delivered—When that is your entire existence. It’s almost as if you don’t care about my business.. Don’t worry, I got your message loud and clear you don’t want my business and I will never give it to you again. Every single person I spoke to at your company today besides Ken, needs training on customer service and customer experience.

1,My husband’s Cancer Medicine stuck in a warehouse,"I just wish to express my EXTREME frustration and dissatisfaction with UPS!   Especially since Rich ironically retired from UPS after 29 yrs!    We’re up at camp in Ignace Ontario, enjoying our summer, after the reassurance that there would be no problem shipping Rich’s VITAL monthly prescription to a location in Dryden, Ontario.    June’s prescription was delivered flawlessly.   Unfortunately, July’s delivery, shipped the last week of June, IS SITTING IN A WAREHOUSE IN WINNIPEG, MANITOBA, being scanned twice daily for 6 days now!!!!!     Yesterday, I spent over 5 frustrating hours trying to reach somebody, to be dumped into “Hold Hell!”, told outright lies that shipping info is incorrect, (while I’m reading the correct info on the shipping label”, was told CUSTOMS didn’t have the correct Comnercial Invoice.  I then spoke with the UPS store in WI, and she reassured me that she had called WINNIPEG, and they DID have the invoice - another lie on the International UPS part.  Finally, today, I called the Canadian Customs Services, and, without sitting on hold AT ALL, I spoke with a very informative and helpful gentleman named, Ryan.    Turns out that UPS has their own customs brokers and blaming customs was just another lie!    Yesterday, I informed the 5 or 6 people from UPS domestic And International customer service that this was absolutely VITAL, $3,000.00 a month medicine and it costs us $146.44 EACH TIME WE SHIP FROM WI TO DRYDEN, ON!   In the shipping labels stated “Medicine While Traveling” !   In summary, there is no plausable excuse for holding a small 1 lb box in the UPS warehouse other than ineptitude and extremely poor customer service!     PS this review will also be placed in as many locations possible.   A more useful use of my time than sitting on hold, receiving the “run around”, and stressing out over my husbands cancer medicine!!!",2024-07-04 17:08:02,US

It was sent to my condo, but I was not home since I was at work. I did not instruct them to do this. All I wanted was for them to keep the package at the access point and the access point could not locate my package. I had to label the package as lost, only to be found by UPS. they took the package to a holding location after a second failed attempt to deliver the package. I go the holding location 30 minutes away, only to say that they have changed their hours since they are short staffed. They do not have a phone number also, so I could not have verified what their hours were. I was just told by the UPS customer service rep that it was at the holding location address. their website is awful too. I kept getting an error after I pay $7.99 to add an access point. their tracking does not track where the package is real time. I was literally waiting for where the next scan of the package will be so I can drive over there and get my package. What a disorganized, understaffed, mess of a company UPS is.

Understand not everybody lives in a house, you deliver to apartment building,  and you sit people packages in front of their apartment door. I have had two packages stolen already because of the same incompetent delivery driver. He will do anything not to come in a building and deliver a package how he is supposed to. Even if you don’t want to deliver a package to the apartment take it to the leasing office. I’m honestly not even sure he delivered my two packages he might be stealing. Not only do I have someone wearing my $140 in perfumes but now they wearing my clothes.

Today, I stayed home from  work, just so I can sit by the front door and wait for the UPS driver...seriously...I followed the truck online and was waiting at the end of the driveway when he showed up so they can't lie and say no one was home to recieve the package. Guess what? He can't find my package on his truck. What a surprise! Now dispatch is trying to figure out where the hell my stuff is. I've never had this problem with USPS or Fed Ex. What the hell? Even Amazon is better than this and they are only 50/50 on delivery.",2024-07-01 20:05:29,US

1,I was expecting an important package,"I was expecting an important package. I have had horrible experiences with UPS in the past, so I asked the shipper to send it ANY other way, but they sent it UPS anyway. First, I got a message that the driver needed a gate code to deliver the package. No one needs a gate code for my house. Then I got a message that my address was incorrect. My address is absolutely correct. It hasn't changed in 25 years. I tried to use their automated assistant to get help. What a waste of time! I sent an email. No response. I called their 800 number. All I got was a message saying to check their website. That is where I started. The people I ordered the item from will never get another order from me.

Last week one drove off without my signature for a thousand dollar iPhone as I’m yelling to him. The package was clearly labeled “signature required” so if paperwork was signed the driver forged my signature.Another driver left a package practically in my yard today! I even have two signs indicating that packages should be placed to the left of my front door hidden from view by the large bush. But I guess the driver didn’t see either sign since he left the package in my walkway! Apparently, there are so many complaints that it’s impossible to reach customer support by phone so I’ll be sure to continue to offer my comments  on social media. Perhaps bad publicity will eventually get some action.",2024-06-30 15:51:50,US

The customer service agent I spoke too was mentally absent and incompetent. I still don't have my package. I can't understand why Amazon continues to use this abomination of a shipping company. They are floating at a review average of 1.2 stars. Somebody please exterminate this infestation called UPS.",2024-06-30 15:26:45,CA
1,Package arrived water logged,"Package arrived water logged.   I mean it was so drenched that nuts and bolts sealed in a ziplock type of bag was drenched and starting to rust.They switched the outer box,  replaced all the articles from the original box and put it into a new box to conceal the fact that the products (skates) were wet an growing mold.   Then Ugly Piece of S  put a spin on the situation and decided to tell me that I was lucky because UPS was going to put file a claim.   I listened to the bozo give me some convoluted statement and he ended up fessing that I would eventually have to get the reimbursement for the items.    Wait....  they water logged my purchased items and tells me that it is the shipper fault since theyshould have put insurance on it.     They water log my purchased items, then switch box (which is illegal) and then tell me it's the shipper's problem because they should have insured it.Ugly Piece of S should have delivered it without damaging it.   The story goes on even further.  The shipper (store) has to now file a claim against Ugly Piece of S and get a measly 100 USD to cover my 880 dollars worth of goods.  I don't think the shop will be willing to reimburse me for anything.   UPS says all legit shops will do that.  Like they would know, after all they aren't going to fight for my reimbursement.On  Reddit and other forums, there are 100s of UPS scammers (workers) writing in, trying to convolute the problem by avoiding the problem or replacing the problem with '' they should have insured it''.  Even if it were insured, there is no guarantee that I will get reimbursed for the water logged items.  Long story short, the items should not have been water logged from the get go.UPS is basically a scam company which will not take responsibility for the horrible mistakes they make.  They hire people to talk on behalf of them to make the situation look like it's someone else to blame.   I wonder how this company stays in business.... wait, corrupt politicians that give them favors at the expense of ordinary citizen.",2024-06-30 08:04:20,JP

My package arrived in Goodyear AZ about midnight, Thursday the 27th/28th. Then they told me it would not be delivered until Monday, July 1st. That means my package sits there all day Friday, Saturday, and Sunday until MAYBE someone decides to pick it up and deliver it. Does UPS work weekends? YES!!!

1,"Damaged package while out for delivery, kept it, puts blame on shipper","My package made it across the United States then UPS damaged it while it was out for delivery, at which point UPS refused to still deliver it, although it was 20 min from my door, and is instead conducting a 1-8 business days-long investigation into how it got damaged, before taking 1-8 more business days to send it back to the shipper. Who the UPS phone reps put both responsibility for the package getting damaged and for providing reimbursement on, although nothing went wrong with the package until the local UPS delivery got their hands on it. My package contained multiple small, expensive items and I had wanted it still delivered to salvage what I could. Other postal or delivery services have delivered damaged, stained, or soaked packages to me but UPS refused to deliver what was already on the van en route to my home because of ""damage"". If it wasn't too much of a problem to keep on the van in order to be investigated later it certainly shouldn't have been an issue to still deliver. It was 30+ aggravating minutes on the phone to find all this out, once tracking ceased after the damage notification. It was clear from the reps' statements that UPS is putting this on the shipper to make good. WHAT A JOKE. I'd be laughing if I weren't out some expensive items thanks to UPS.",2024-06-29 22:25:44,US

2,Avoid if possible,"This feedback is based on multiple deliveries over the past year.I gave 1 star as I've always received my packages (in the end) and 1 star because they're usually in good condition (although once a package was unrecognizable).But as most others have pointed out, it takes a minor miracle for UPS to actually delivery to your door and/or contact you about your shipment. They say they've attempted delivery, but unless you live in a house, they never attempt to get the package to you and don't inform you of the status of the shipment.After checking the status of the shipment yourself and seeing the 'delivery attempt', you can contact UPS to have the shipment delivered to a local pick-up point (else you'll have to pick it up from their office in Vantaa).Their customer service is polite but they give worthless information about your shipment -- if they say it will be delivered by a certain time/date, you know it's going to be a few days later than quoted.Also, their drivers do not have phones, thus they have no way to contact you for help with directions or getting your door code. It's dumbfounding this is still the case in 2024.In conclusion, avoid having your shipment delivered by UPS if at all possible. You will likely receive your package in good condition, but it'll be a battle of epic proportions in the end.",2024-06-29 13:23:44,FI

5,Exceptional Customer Service Experience with UPS during Parcel Hold-Up,"I am thrilled to share my recent experience with UPS involving the delivery of a parcel from Spain to the UK. Despite facing an unexpected delay due to the parcel being held by the Spain Government Agency for three weeks, the outstanding customer service I received from UPS, particularly from two remarkable individuals, Maria and Bea, truly made a significant difference in resolving the issue.Upon encountering the delay, I reached out to UPS customer service in the UK for assistance. Initially, I faced challenges as I received conflicting information from different customer advisers during numerous phone calls. Feeling frustrated, I decided to visit the Stanford UPS depot, where I had the pleasure of meeting Maria King a highly professional and friendly customer adviser. Maria went above and beyond to assist me, ensuring that I would receive my parcel at the earliest convenience.Moreover, my interactions with Bea, another exceptional member of the UPS team, were equally remarkable. Bea assured me that she would personally handle my case and utilize all available resources to expedite the release of my parcel from the Spain Government Agency. Throughout the process, Bea kept me informed with regular updates, displaying a high level of commitment and dedication to resolving my issue promptly.It is undeniable that without the unwavering dedication and exceptional customer service provided by Maria and Bea, my parcel may have never been released from the hold-up in Spain. Their professionalism, kindness, and determination to assist me in every possible way are truly commendable.I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Maria and Bea for their outstanding support, patience, and relentless efforts in resolving my parcel issue efficiently. Their exemplary service has left a lasting impression on me, and I am truly grateful for their exceptional assistance during this challenging situation.

5,UPS store employees are life-savers,"I see there are quite a few complaints about shipping with UPS, but that's not all they offer.The UPS store near me  (Hamilton Square, State College,  PA). has pretty much saved my life several times,  by helping me Fax and send uploads of documents and pictures for important communications (financial and medical).Most recently,  an employee named Chris  facilitated my sending required documentation to the Anderson Cancer Center in Texas for upcoming consults for a breast cancer - not a fun prospect!They require one to upload (front and back) drivers' license, and whatever insurance cards one has (in my case, three) - all to go to their PORTAL.Sorry,  but I'm kind of a technoklutz and apart from photographing the cards with my iPhone camera, I was lost.  Furthermore, it was urgent to complete my online registration prior to my major trip within days.  (Don't know why they assume everyone is adept at such online functions!)He dropped what he was doing and managed the feat, beginning by attaching the documentation by sending the photos to my own email and from there to the Anderson's Portal. And that's far from the only time they have bailed me out in such important online transactions!  Don't forget when you're dissing UPS shipping that that's not all they help with!  My experience has been that the store employees are extraordinary - really go above and beyond.  Give credit where credit is due!  They must really make a point of hiring extra qualified and humane staff at the stores.",2024-06-23 13:49:25,US

1,UPS = Universally Poor Service.,"UPS = Universally Poor Service.As a rule I avoid have avoided using this courier whenever possible due to their consistently disappointing service. When packages are delivered, if they're not lost in transit, they tend to arrive late or damaged. I recently ordered some urgent spares from a vendor and paid a considerable fee to have them expedited for 24hr/next day delivery. Had I know they'd use UPS I would have opted for standard mail (which actually gets delivered on the weekend as well). Once the tracking info arrived, I was disappointed to see UPS as the courier, yet surprised to see a next day delivery on Wednesday. Come 9pm on Wednesday, there had been no mobile/text updates which I had specifically signed up for. Checking the website there was a notification that the shipment was delayed due to ""mechanical failure"" - what, one of your trucks broke down and you don't have another one? The bar code reader's batteries were flat? Someone spilt coffee on the keyboard and there isn't a spare one? No further information regarding delivery days/times or progress, no web chat available, no email response, 45 mins in a queue on the phone only to be told that I should check the tracking details online... the standard incompetent, useless customer service that typifies UPS. All up it took 6 days for the package to be delivered... bear in mind this was a 24hr expedited shipment. Would I recommend UPS, never, not to anyone.

I made the payment and awaited delivery. Unfortunately, Dell delivered the package to an incorrect address, where it was received by an individual named Fabricio. I personally contacted Fabricio, who informed me that he had returned the package.I then reached out to UPS (Tracking ID:1ZW70W980316759362), the courier service entirely contracted by Dell, to investigate the whereabouts of my package. However, UPS stated that I needed authorization from Dell to proceed with the investigation. This situation exemplifies a series of errors and a troubling lack of accountability between the companies involved, leaving me, the consumer, with violated rights and significant financial and emotional distress. Moreover, I urgently require this notebook for my work.I have contacted Dell support numerous times, only to be repeatedly attended to by an inadequate representative named Shane, who seems solely interested in sending automated responses rather than resolving customer issues.This entire experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing.

1,Why is zero not an option?,"I chose one star only because zero was not an option. Yesterday UPS delivered a package to me.. I was waiting on some Amazon so I grabbed it and opened it only to realize I didn’t recognize it as anything I’d ordered. Upon looking, it was addressed to my address but for someone I don’t know (in someone else’s name) so I made the epically horrible decision to call the customer service number. As I’ve sadly come to expect, a robot answered and I patiently listened and waited for my opportunity to request an agent. *spoiler alert : no matter what you say this thing will not connect you to a person but if you utterly get belligerent with it, she eventually says “I can’t connect you to an agent” and as you hit repeat lol because you can’t believe what you just heard and hear clearly “I can’t connect you to an agent” the urge to throw your phone into your yard is overwhelming paired with a desire to slap the bot in the face then you realize it has no face and you laugh and get on FB , type in the name on the package, send this person a msg telling them what happened then they drive to your house and get it and everyone is happy. However, I feel that I did the job of a UPS employee yesterday and I would like to know who to call to get my direct deposit going.. because you guys know that it sometimes takes a check or two for that to kick in so I’d like that number asap please. I did enjoy my interaction with the local UPS store tho.. this guy was hilarious and hated to tell me that he could not reach drivers and I’d probably have to go to the hub as apparently the hub has no phone. I could tell by his tone that he was ashamed at that moment, to be affiliated with UPS. Lastly, don’t try to prove me wrong, don’t call the number thinking, that woman must be exaggerating, because by the time you realize you are genuinely infuriated with an inanimate figure, basically just a computer generated voice, and you’re screaming AGENT!! HUMAN!! Well, at that point it’s just too late. My hats off to UPS for taking customer service to a whole different level and that in no way is a compliment. ✌🏻",2024-06-21 14:28:20,US

This happened in May & my package was almost a month late! I called UPS customer support & all I got from it was high blood pressure & lies! The genius I spoke with kept telling me it was only scheduled for delivery 1 time (yesterday) & because it was a holiday, it was rescheduled. If that was the case, why have I been receiving tracking updates from UPS saying otherwise. His explanation...I MISUNDERSTOOD THE MESSAGES! My response to that is that while he, and his cohorts may very well be mentally challenged, incompetent and/or illiterate, I AM NOT! It would be VERY difficult to misunderstand ""your package is arriving tomorrow"" (followed by the date)! Bottom line...UPS sucks when they used to be the best.

1,Extremely disappointing and frustrating experience with UPS,"I recently had my first experience with UPS when I needed to send a letter with important documents. Initially, the procedures seemed fine – I created an account, logged in, and generated a label to attach to the letter. However, several drop-off locations were unfamiliar with scanning such packages, likely due to lower usage compared to the national postal service.I received a receipt indicating that the letter would arrive within a couple of days. However, tracking soon showed that the letter sat in a warehouse for over a week without any movement. After several calls to UPS, I encountered polite but not particularly helpful representatives. They informed me that I had used the wrong postage and that this service option was not available for Italy. How could I have known, given that it already cost several hundred kroner for a small letter?After locating the letter somewhere in their system and scanning it, UPS decided to return the letter to me due to incorrect postage. I made more calls and eventually received an email instructing me to create a new label with additional postage, costing another hundred kroner. I sent the new label via email but received no response. Nearly two days and multiple calls later, I was informed that the letter was finally on its way to the recipient, now with a new tracking number. Shortly afterward, I learned that the letter had arrived.After many years of using the Norwegian postal service, this was the worst, slowest, and most expensive experience I've ever had. UPS needs significant improvements in their service and customer support to match even basic expectations.",2024-06-20 16:31:42,NO

1,UPS Delivery Problems,"I'm so sick of UPS drivers' apathy when it comes to alerting customers that their packages have arrived. Why don't they have the courtesy to knock on the door? I live in an apartment complex, and there's only been one instance when a UPS driver knocked on my door in the last year to pick up a return. Usually they just stuff the labels in my door knocker and run off. I'm charged $7.99 by Amazon whenever I need a return picked up at home. I'm terminally ill so that's more often than not. I have to call Amazon back and report the incident and hope they can resolve it with UPS and have them come back again. As frustrating as that is, it's nothing compared to having drivers leave packages outside my door without so much as a knock to let me know it's arrived. I shouldn't have to check the tracking number every 5 minutes or risk another resident hovering over it or worse, my order gone without a trace and UPS asking me to provide proof of my word. How can I prove my driver didn't knock or yell or make any noise at all?   Of course they apologize for any bad experience and promise to note my account with instructions to ""Knock hard"". I'm always home and always in my living room. Both of my doors are in the living room so there's no excuse. I'm going to request that they hand packages and labels to me, but I expect that to go over like a lead balloon. Every once in awhile I'll hear them rustling around outside, but by the time I get to the door, they are either in their truck or in a dead run toward it. Call for them all you want. They won't even look back. Does anyone have a solution?",2024-06-20 00:31:10,US

1,UPS Bait & Switch - Illegal Business Practices.,When you purchase shipping from UPS they inform you that you can drop it off at a DPD depot or collection centre for free. Once you've bought the £15 shipping they inform you that due to the value of the item collection centres cannot accept it. Resulting in you having to pay for a collection at an additional cost. The agreement entered into had free drop off options which are apparently no longer available. Meaning the company have now after your £15 commitment demanded a further payment for a collection or your original purchase becomes useless. In the UK this is referred to unilateral amendment of a contract which is not lawful. If you call up customer support because they do not speak fluent English but read from a script they have no understanding of the issue and just say 'sorry sir' on repeat.,2024-06-18 16:31:22,GB

UPS then sent me an e-mail to say it would be delivered by end of day.  Then, at about 4pm I got an e-mail stating it will not be delivered until Monday.  Monday came and went with no delivery.  There's no way to speak to a human about your parcel - their website is dreadful for finding support.

It's despicable and pathetic and they are just full of excuses. Did I mention how filthy, dirty damaged and disgusting the package arrived. I have a video, proof of footage, this is the reason for installing a camera, because of all the delivery people just throwing packages and never knocking or handing the package in person or ever signing anything despite paying extra for this service. Of course it's also outsourced to India so good luck speaking to someone who actually speaks and understand what you are trying to say. Has anyone had luck filing a complaint?

Tried calling and got yet another robot. I spoke the tracking number clearly one digit at a time twice. It didn't understand. I put the number in on the keypad and again it couldn't understand even that.  I tried for an agent and was told an agent couldn't help me either.  The bot finally said call back when you haveyour tracking number, the very one I had given it 3 times.  It hung up.  How can you run a business and only know a person when you are wanting ninety from them but not know a person when they need help with services you were already paid for??  This is not a good way to run a business and very poor customer relations.  Please use fedex next time.  I'm out of an item coz I have a delivery photo of a door jamb.  Since you aren't available to help me,  and I'm out of money for an item I purchased,  bring back the door jamb since that is proof of delivery.  I'll take it to the scrap yard so that way I'll have part of my money back. With your prices, why would you make it so hard to try to track down your item and really offer no assistance?Isn't that what a company is paid for.

UPS made the decision to destroy our property without consent and without notifying us about the damaged shipment! We contacted the UPS shipping store, and they referred us to UPS corporate. UPS corporate sent us back to the UPS store. Since then, we have received a complete run around and still do not understand what happened to cause such damage and why UPS took the liberty to destroy our property without consent.

1,Disgusting! Awful company! Do not use! Staff Lie and do not care,"Have a parcel being delivered to a business address, more specifically a motorcycle dealership. I was told by 5 different staff members, my parcel was 100% guaranteed to be delivered by 5pm on the 13th June 2023. This was a complete lie. The dealership closes at 6pm every day and the specified delivery on the app said 7pm even though it's a business address and have been told by countless staff that the business address deliveries finish at 5pm. The staff have no care or respect within the company. They tell you what you want! I then told them that as a result of them failing to uphold this guarantee, my parcel MUST under no circumstance, be delivered later than 11am on the 14th June 2024. Again staff guaranteed this would happen. They have yet again failed! As a result I am going to be charged an additional £200-£300 storage fee from the dealership! The staff do not care about it's customers, problems or concerns. This is totally unacceptable. They state they are the fastest service and most caring, again clearly that's more lies from the company. I will be taking this action much farther. I have a scheduled interview with the Daily Mail and The Sun Newspapers. I will not be letting this go lightly and UPS will be paying the additional charge if my parcel is not received at the dealership by 11am on the 14th June 2024. It's a disgusting service. This may be acceptable in the states. But not in United Kingdom.I will not be using this company ever again and I strongly, strongly advise anyone else sending a parcel to stay clear from them as they cannot even guarantee a simple request. It's vile!Head Office will be receiving the invoice and if they fail to pay it, I will be seeking legal action against the company.

About 1:30 pm another message says attempted to delivery and no one home.  The problem is UPS was dishonest.  My wife was home.  Ring camera didn't record any activity at front door.  No note left saying UPS will try again.  Additionally checked with a neighbor.  His security camera points right at my home.  UPS driver is captured driving past my home at 1:30 pm and never stopped.  My neighbor looked at more footage after 1:30 pm timeline of video recording and UPS truck never seen again. I called the shipper and had the package redirected to a UPS store.  5/23/24 I arrived to pick up my package.  The box was in terrible condition.  It contains wine.  Clearly the contents were repackaged due to damage by UPS.  I say this because the shipper using a box with their brand all over the box. The box I picked up was a plain brown box. The seller I buy from uses heavy duty boxes with internal protection for the wine.  UPS had to have dropped the box or ran over it in the shipping process.  I had two bottles missing.I called UPS and call agent took my information and assured me someone from local UPS station would call by 10:00 a.m. following day.  I am never received that call.  I called back UPS on June 6.  I aske call agent if any notes available from my previous call.  She stated it says someone called no one answered and my phone unable to record a voice mail.

The second box arrived less than an hour ago, tightly wrapped in transparent tape resembling a rectangular mummy, which unfortunately trapped humidity inside. Fortunately, someone at UPS managed to remove the glass shards before hastily repacking the box.The delivery driver provided no explanation for the incidents, merely shrugging and requesting my signature for the damaged goods.One bottle breaking can be considered an accident. The same event occuring two days after the first is a trend and a sign of substandard working procedures.

In the end they gave us $100 for an item they lost valued over $300. We gave them photos and receipts.  They wouldn't even reimburse the shipping we paid on lost item. UPS is a cluster truck and predict they will go bankrupt in a few years",2024-06-12 04:23:06,US

They failed to make a delivery due to an issue with an address and tried to contact the seller to get an updated address at 7pm. When the seller didn’t respond within two hours, which of course they would not because it was out of office hours they decided to ship it back to the seller rather than hold it, costing me now double the shipping cost for no item. If they had a reasonable waiting time they would have gotten a response the next day and it could have been resolved. I presume this will be built into their business model to increase the changes of parcels just being shipped back to the sender to increase their revenue.

1,UPS absolutely sucks,"UPS absolutely sucks. They are the only carrier that doesn't deliver to my building. Even though I leave instruction for them to leave my package is in the mail room, the driver refuses to because they say this is a high theft area. That's complete BS. It's a busy little tourist town that the drivers don't want to deal with so they say there was nobody here and they never even try to deliver the packages. They give their drivers the ability to do their job if they want to or not. There's no accountability for the drivers if they decide to not come to your building and try to deliver anything. All they have to say is they weren't comfortable. Every other delivery service gets the job done but UPS just can't. Every time I call they repeatedly default on what they promised to do. There UPS my choice option is a complete waste of money because they don't listen to what you say and you can track things for free anyway.

My package was out for delivery today and I received a notification that they attempted to deliver but my address was incorrect! I took a screenshot of my correct address on UPS website for proof and a very detailed message to send via email but of course, once submitted, an unexpected error occurred. You can’t reach an agent, you can’t contact anyone with these people and it’s frustrating as hell. UPS been needed to retire, it’s the same complaints everyday and nothing is getting down about it.

5,I had written a prior review on this…,"I had written a prior review on this company dealing with this specific shipment that I am giving a 5 star review on.So what changed to make me write a 5 star review? It's because of one individual at the Fort Erie, ON, Canada location who helped tremendously in getting this sorted out.I was given incorrect data by the UPS agent who suggested that I do a self assessment to eliminate the brokerage charges that had been left on the item after I provided proof of purchase that the items were being returned to me. He told me that I could do a self assessment even though the goods had been cleared by customs in Fort Erie. He emailed the individual in charge of clearance at Fort Erie and she sent me the instructions on what to do, which included a copy of the commercial invoice that was filled out by me (I did this online and sent the label to the friend who was sending this item back to me).I went to the Canadian Border Services Agency office located at Hamilton Airport last Friday (31st May) and was given a bunch of arbitrary data by the Agent there. I was asked for a cargo control manifest number which is impossible to get after an item has been cleared and released by customs. He knew this but I didn't and he sent me on a wild goose chase. So I went back on June the 4th with more proof of who I was and I spoke to a different agent who was the one who told me that once it clears customs they have nothing to do with it. He then inferred that I had not given the correct data the first time I had been (on the 31st May), which I had but used different words - 'its out on delivery' instead of 'its been cleared by customs'. It can't be out on delivery UNLESS it has been cleared by customs so the agent on the 31st of May was quite the ass****. The second time I waited for 20+ minutes for someone to come up to the window at the CBSA. The original chap refused to come to the window even though that was his job. So a chap with the nametag Armstrong talked to me. I wish I had talked to him originally.Anyway, I left empty handed without the B15 which UPS were trying to get from me to cancel the brokerage charges. I stopped off at a nearby community center to call Tracy at UPS in Fort Erie and she said she would do what she could to get the brokerage charges removed. She called me the next day and sent an email to say that all brokerage charges had been removed and that I could pick up my item locally myself. Without Tracy helping me this outcome would not have happened. Thank You!!!!A word about the agents who answer the phone... there were at least two agents who, when they put me on hold inadvertently put me through to the survey, hence ending the call. I had to ring back each time to get back to a supervisor. In total I spent over 12 hours on the phone with UPS calling the regular number to try and get this resolved. And the supervisor who told me to do the self assessment was wrong. One CANNOT self assess unless one does so BEFORE the shipment is shipped. This way the item, when it arrives at the clearing port, will be held until CBSA can visually check the goods.And the CBSA agent who sent me on a wild goose chase, if I had remembered your name from your nametag I would have mentioned it here. As it is I didn't see it, but shame on you, you awful public servant.",2024-06-27 09:30:47,CA

I shipped a new child bike present to Italy for Xmas. It got back to London after over 1 months. The box was open and resealed and the bike was intentionally hit and destroyed in the core parts (ie the chain and brakes), whilst the basket and doll holder (very fragile) were intact. I gathered that it happened in Catania, specifically.After 3 months of claim, long telephone calls, idiocy (perhaps fake ) by the staff, which hardly speak English, emails and inspection, I managed to get refunded for the shipping cost and bike. After 6 months, I got invoices from them asking me to pay the shipping cost and customs . I was leaving this address and got that letter by pure chance. Again, calls, emails, kids answering the phone and emails with completely macaronic English, I have been told to ignore that invoice. Is it all ended?

I could not find out when UPS would try again ('next working day'), so tried phoning the only contact number given (a USA number) but the automated voice recognition did not work.  I then used 'chat' and after a delay one of their staff responded, but then had to refer me to another person on chat - I waited at least 10-15 mins as instructed but the call seemed to have ended, as no one responded.  So I gave up and emailed UPS. No response yet - only a request to complete a customer survey.  UPS offers the option of joining a UPS customer programme to allow control over delivery times - I tried to join, provided all my personal data, and then found that whatever I had joined did not seem to give me the delivery date control options.  UPS makes it impossible to speak to a human being - only to a machine, which is very demoralising.   So all in all, I find UPS dysfunctional, unhelpful, and inaccessible.  According to the tracker, the delivery was then scheduled for the next day between 13:40 and 15:40hrs.  In fact, it was delivered and left in the porch at 08:04hrs.

1,Is UPS even following the law?,"As a customer eagerly awaiting multiple delayed packages crucial for my upcoming vacation, One of which appears to just be sitting in a warehouse for days with no updates, I find myself frustrated and deeply concerned by the inefficiencies plaguing UPS, as highlighted in a recent Reddit post I came across created by UPS workers. The inability to provide a delivery date for one of my packages is unacceptable, especially considering the ample time it has been in their possession with no explanation as to why it hasn’t arrive nor has it left the last warehouse it was reported to be at. The revelations from UPS employees about packages not being properly processed, returned, or even misplaced due to lack of adequate staffing and clerical support raise serious doubts about UPS's commitment to customer service and operational integrity. It appears that UPS may be violating consumer rights and possibly even engaging in false advertising by failing to deliver on their promises of reliable and timely package delivery services.These issues may potentially violate consumer protection laws, particularly in terms of false advertising and failure to deliver services as promised. The lack of proper staffing and support for clerical duties not only disrupts the delivery process but also puts undue burden and responsibility on drivers, leading to further delays and potential errors.Furthermore, the reduction in clerk positions and the imposition of unrealistic workload restrictions, as described by UPS employees, not only compromise the efficiency of operations but also raise concerns about workplace safety and employee well-being. It's alarming to hear about safety hazards emerging as a result of these operational changes, highlighting a blatant disregard for both customer satisfaction and employee welfare.UPS's failure to address these systemic issues not only jeopardizes customer trust and satisfaction but also raises serious ethical and legal concerns regarding their business practices. As a loyal customer, I urge UPS to take immediate and comprehensive action to rectify these issues and ensure that such incidents do not recur in the future.",2024-06-03 05:48:22,US

1,HORRIBLE,"HORRIBLE — once again!!!HORRIBLE — AGAIN!! UPS (so far just on the weekends) keeps delivering to locations that are NOT my house! Two weeks ago I found my shipment a couple of acres over on another property (with no house) thrown on the ground in the weeds. Today my two packages were delivered at the bottom of the hill I live on, in my garbage collection area (EWW) and they’re both 100#’s so I can’t lift them into my car! I’m a pretty fit 54 year old and the dead weight of these items is just much to lift. So the company I ordered from, Frontgate, has had to issue a return ticket in order to get UPS out here to pick them back up and ship them back to them. They re-ordered my items and we’re crossing our fingers that they’ll arrive during the week when the driver will actually bring them up to my house. Unfortunately, UPS’s all electronic “customer service“ makes it impossible to get ahold of a person and try to send the driver back or find some other resolution. I’m to the point where I’m starting to ask companies I order from who they ship with and I won’t buy from them if they don’t offer something other than UPS. It’s so sad, as their customer service has gone down the toilet. I’m still dealing with a shipment that never arrived about a month ago and their driver claims he delivered them to the right place, and gave the name of a person that doesn’t work at the location it was to be delivered to. So I’m just eating that $300. Horrible company now — too bad I can only list one date and tracking number on this rating.

I was actually answering my door to a DPS courier at exactly the time UPS gave for their supposed delivery attempt. 08.49amAccording to several UPS employees on Reddit UPS do this when an item is loaded onto the wrong vehicle so it may well not have been the driver telling lies.I called their customer service line to be told that they would contact the depot and have them call me.A lady from the depot called me at 10.29 to say they had asked the driver to re deliverand she would call back to confirm.An hour later I had heard nothing so called customer service again. Was told they would chase up the depot and I would be contacted within 60 minutes.90 minutes later, still no contact so I called customer service again and asked for a supervisor.30 minutes later supervisor called me back. It’s now 2.30 pm. He was very apologetic and said he would chase the depot personally.An hour later he called back and said the depot had refused to deliver today. Just couldn’t be bothered to tell me.A whole day wasted calling for information which I could have been given at 10.30 and all because they lied to me on the first instance.I should add that all the customer service employees genuinely tried to help. It’s the management who made these shameful decisions and hid behind them that I am incandescent with rage about.It’s now 8pm and I have chased them up 8 times now. Still no call from the depot despite being told each time I called customer service that the depot would call.Asked to speak to a supervisor again and was left on hold for 30 minutes and finally disconnected.Clearly they couldn’t care less about their customers or their customers recipients.I will be advising the eBay vendor just how bad this service has been.U nbelievablyP oorS erviceDate of experience: 30 May 2024",2024-05-30 21:39:34,AE

They were also very rude and had zero customer service. I later asked for a refund and they refused. They claim that it was my fault that the item wasn't delivered on time.

Waited 4 weeks for a parcel and received a delivery notice stating it had been left in my porch despite being in at the time ( I don’t have a porch so that would be difficult!).when I looked at the drivers delivery photo it was clearly not my house. Trying to actually speak to someone from UPS to report the problem was like trying to knit fog. Virtual assistant/ automated options - none have a ‘report a problem with my delivery’. When I did finally get thru to a human she spoke like a computer simulated voice- very difficult to understand. This was over £300 worth of goods and as usual the drivers they employ don’t give a toss about where they dump stuff - most of them are lazy and careless - probably wouldn’t be if delivering to one of their family.

1,UPS = UNRELIABLE PRETEND SERVICES,"This company has rapidly declined in the last few years, with 2022 being a key marker for the start of a very noticeable decline.Once revered as a ‘giant’ and ‘leader’ in this industry, they have quickly become shockingly useless to the point where it begs to ask the question, ‘Why does any one, or business, use UPS as a parcel carrier in 2024?’.Seriously, I would welcome answers because I’m have an incredibly difficult time comprehending how paying money for nearly any service they offer is even considered legitimately performed as described. Main complaints surround the sheer unreliability of tracking (should any exist/function as an actual means of tracking) and all the inconsistencies and potential issues that almost certain will arise from using a logistics company that cannot even provide valid tracking updates and more times than less will truly have no idea where packages may be (often encouraging their own employees to help blur these lines).When you cannot properly track parcel, and said parcel is already ’moving’ at an exuberantly slow pace as it crawls across the United States not being tracked at all, missing guaranteed delivery dates by significant margins becomes an unacceptable norm.It remains unclear to me, and many others online, how exactly any individual or business can have any confidence in UPS these days. Is there a part of this joke that I’m missing? - Just another disappointed customer in the faceless sea of what I can only assume is tens of millions of individuals and businesses alike.

1,UPS IS TOTALLY UNCONCERNED WITH CUSTOMER  SATISFACTION,This is a completely disgusting company which has very poor leadership and absolutely useless management which should all be replaced immediately . 92%of customers are dissatisfied with their service from the company which is an absolute disgrace. I was quoted on the UPS system with a shipping rate $30.95 . when I went into the local UPS store the rate they wanted me to pay for exactly the same shipment was $101.80. When I heard this I explained that I got the $30.95 rate off the UPS phone system and they said no it is the $101.80 rate. Twenty four-hour after getting my quote the rate the system quotes for exactly the same shipment is still $30.95. Any reasonably run company provides better service than UPS at a lower cost. Two good examples are FedEx which is consistently 25 to 30 lower than UPS and who is used for my shipment. Another good example is Amazon who will not use UPS under any condition and instead runs their own delivery service. This is a company that needs a complete management change or needs to be put out of business. No company will survive long term with a 92% dissatisfaction rating,2024-05-24 16:32:17,US

It appears as delivered and signed by a receptionist. So far I have reached to:- customer service multiple times- Investigation team requested to fill a form which I did straight away, resent it the next day cos didn't get a confirmation. And about 5 days later reach out again and the guy told ""I never fill up the form"" ... Yes because someone with plenty of expertise in the IT sector don't know how to fill up a form and attach it to an email. - Reach out to escalation team which asked me to fill again the form I had sent 3 times before.- Investigation team closed the investigation claiming ""lack of description""It is outrageous how these people just seem to pass the ball here and nobody taking responsibility for the customer packages. I know I am 1 in thousands of packages handled daily and I have been as patient as possible but is a big box! Aprox. 100 x 50cm = 30kgHow can you lose that for more than a month? I want to believe is actually ""lost"" and an employee didn't delivered but to his house.I really want to thank Mac Vilyon G. from customer service, is the ONLY person which actually understand the customer and has been genuinely trying to help with it. Besides that everyone is just taking a joke here .... I don't want to generalize as surely there should be ppl working there that actually do their job, but if you want to avoid a headache please use another service to ensure your package is properly handled. I honestly considering at this point to use my technical skills to test their system, have not idea how else to raise their attention but will start posting this until I my package is found or I get tired which is nowhere soon.",2024-05-24 11:36:06,IE

When my pool is torn apart and the installer is here and for now two consecutive days the package isnt that’s an expense to me. Then to be told if I want it sooner come pick it up,  over an hours drive away. The status update states out for delivery for two days so how am I being told to come pick it up????When clothes ordered from Macy’s are left on the ground in the rain WITH NO PLASTIC 5 ft away from my package drop, clothing are now totally soaked and dirty from the rain. FedEx on the other hand calls me to inquire about preference when weather is bad. Upon relaying this to UPS was told their drivers are not allowed to carry phones. REALLY!

They could have put it in a trash bag and delivered it.  I didn’t care about the frames or the glass. I would gladly have taken responsibility for receiving the damaged package.  If they had to open the box to determine the level of damage, it couldn’t have been anything like “dangerous to ship.” They could have done any number of things but they chose to throw the package away and now my grandmother’s handmade artwork is gone.  I’ll pay more to ship with literally anyone else from now on.

It just keeps going around and around and I can't get anywhere and the virtual assistant tool tells me to access My Choice to change delivery date so that too is useless! How is it good customer service to be so complicated as a service that your customers are literally screaming at their phones?

It just claims apocalyptic weather conditions is causing the delay as of 0551am today. No update since. I must be imagining the dry and breezy conditions I have experienced all day. Will I ever receive my parcel? Who knows? Worst courier ever.Update 17/5/24. UPS have still not managed to deliver my parcel. After no update whatsoever I reviewed my tracking. Apparently there's an issue with my address. The postman, Amazon et al find my house with great regularity. To be fair to Reece who contacted me via Messenger, he tried to be helpful. However, once he had passed my mobile number to their customer service team (very loose definition) I was contacted by natalie. After I listened to natalie I told her that I had heard a plethora of excuses which did not move my parcel any nearer to me. After I explained I have a family member living near Castle Donington, the alleged ups location of said ""severe weather"" the geography altered somewhat. Apparently the bad weather which caused the initial delay had occurred in Cologne, France (Yes, France is what I was told). The excuses continued and, after confirming my address, I told natalie that this conversation was over as we were achieving nothing. natalie managed to put the phone down before me. If only the rest of the ups operation was so efficient",2024-05-17 13:41:59,GB

If they come to deliver it in the middle of the day while everyone is at work they will send the package I paid for and am waiting on back to the place I bought it. Then when you call you have to wait 20 minutes or more to talk to someone that want wait for the problem to be solved. So after they are off the phone you try to create an account and do what was said but it doesn’t work.

1,UPS steals your packages,"I had a package delivered to the wrong address which had a secure mail room were you had to go retrieve your package.I had contacted the actually building where it was located and they had said a UPS driver had came to collect it that day . I then again contacted UPS and asked if they could deliver it to my address or to a IPS location for collection, they told me that they would have to re ship it back the the shipper . I contacted the shipper and they told me that they haven’t received there isn’t any tracking indication of the item being sent back to them and that it is showing as delivered even though the building reception told me the exact unit number package that the UPS driver took . So long story short UPS could re delivery my package but took the time to go a reclaim it for themselves. The package was car parts which don’t come cheap .Its pretty bad that you have to be afraid of the packages being stolen from your steps no now you have to worry about UPS employees stealing packages your packages!!!!",2024-05-09 03:21:51,CA

Also, I have a sunroom in my house, which faces the street. The su room door is unlocked and I put instructions asking to leave packages in the sun room. They never do. UPS would rather leave packages outside the sunroom in the driving rain and snow storms to completely destroy the package and its contents. Not to mention UPS leaves it in plain view for the porch pirates to steal it. Is it just plain laziness to not open a screen door and place a package safely inside??

It took FOREVER to finally be able to speak to someone.  It shouldn't be so difficult to speak to a person.  The person I spoke to could not give me any information about why it hadn't been delivered. I needed the package so wanted to pick it up. I told the representative that. The website is ridiculous and I could not make arrangements to pick it up.Between tracking the package a ton of times, trying to call and speak to someone, being on hold, or waiting for delivery, this cost me A LOT of time.

1,Broken,"BrokenShipping and Receiving is difficult. Most people who are frustrated are waiting for something and find out it will be delayed or worse. However, the problem with UPS has nothing to do with those kinds of issues. It's that their system is deeply broken and it seems like rather than trying to fix it they are trying to slash prices further and further through very cheap automation. In the past year I have had probably 20 UPS deliveries, about 85% had significant issues and nearly all of them could have been solved by simple communication. UPS has painted themselves into a corner with cheapness and now the customer and service workers pay for it while those who implemented said system get paid for it. The one positive is they do sort of save me money, because when I see a company is using UPS exclusively I now don't purchase from them because I don't want to deal with the guaranteed issues.",2024-05-02 19:41:30,US

I wish that there was some way that I could attach both pictures to this review to show the vast difference between the house that the UPS driver delivered the package to and the house that actually belonged to the customer. Anyway, even after sending UPS pictures of the drastic difference between the driver's ""proof of delivery"" photo and the actual photo of the customer's house, UPS still refused our reimbursement claim since the driver took a picture of some random house. I think it is worth it to pay extra to use FedEx since their drivers are actually reliable and their customer service is good.",2024-05-02 19:10:31,US

1,UPS lottery - sometimes they do find your address.,"Again you could not find my home address.

Everybody else, from the pizza guy to the postal guy etc are able to find my house. And sometimes even UPS succeeded! The sender paid for the package to be delivered at the home address and it is should be delivered against a signature. So, UPS is charging for a service that also is not delivered. I believe, this is something they do with all packages in order to save fuel and salary cost. By dropping all the packages at a collection point, the save a lot. Plus they are still charging for the delivery.Customer service is arrogant and absolutely not willing to help in any way. They could of course ""make another attempt"" but then I would have to wait at least for a week - according to customer service.I think you are scamming people on a calculated risk by being taken to cost - due the insignificant amounts involved.Somebody should bring you to court for this scaming business.",2024-05-02 14:32:03,SE

I couldn't email for support either because I do not have a tracking number and that is required on their form.

I sent important documents to the Canadian embassy in Manila through UPS, expecting a smooth and efficient delivery process. However, it turned into a nightmare.Firstly, I was repeatedly call UPS customer service to locate my documents, to track my documents. The customer service representatives were absolutely clueless and seemed incompetent, providing vague and unhelpful responses.Their excuse for not being able to locate the Canadian embassy, a well-known location, is utterly unacceptable. If tourists and locals unfamiliar with Manila can find the embassy, how is it that a courier service like UPS cannot manage to do the same?To make matters worse, UPS failed to deliver the documents as promised. I had to resort to sending my brother and sister all the way from Batangas to Manila just to pick up the documents that UPS was supposed to deliver. This defeats the entire purpose of paying for a delivery service in the first place.Overall, UPS Philippines' inefficiency, lack of competence, and poor customer service have left me deeply dissatisfied and inconvenienced.

1,UPS deceives and mistreats their customer,"UPS deceives and mistreats their customers in terms of delivery. They failed to collect packages at the designated time, resulting in a one-day delay in the delivery process. They ended up delivering on Friday much sooner than the expected delivery time I was given.On the second attempt at delivery, the driver arrived on Saturday but was about to leave without leaving a note. However, someone from the house stopped the driver and asked why he was leaving. The driver explained that the package had been forgotten and was not loaded into his truck. Apologizing, he then informed them that they would have to wait until Monday to receive the package. On Monday, after utilizing the ineffective and untrustworthy MyChoice UPS App, it indicated that the driver approached my location but subsequently returned to the warehouse by 6 pm. I contacted their customer service line and was informed that the tracking information I possessed was incorrect, as per their records, the package was still in the process of being delivered. The UPS rep told me to give the driver ample time to deliver my package by 9:00pm. I contacted them right before 9:00pm to let them know that my package had not arrived yet.The representative hesitated to assist, explaining that there is limited assistance available because everyone has already left for the day. She suggested waiting until 9:00pm for the package to be delivered. I requested her to wait for just 4 more minutes as the package, which was supposed to be delivered within two days, has already exceeded its expected delivery time. She helped reluctantly, mentioning that she would see if she could send a message to the dispatcher. After checking, she returned and informed me that she could leave a message for the dispatcher to call me the next day. However, she also mentioned that there was still a possibility that I might receive my package, as sometimes the drivers, who are supposed to return by 9:00 pm, may be late. It is now past 10:00 pm, and there is still no sign of the driver or any notification regarding my package.Multiple UPS representatives have consistently deceived me, preventing me from visiting their warehouse to collect the item unless I utilize their malfunctioning app, and seeking assistance from the representatives proved exceptionally difficult. Additionally, they provided conflicting information.Attempting to voice my complaint to manager Eric/Erik turned out to be disheartening as he outright expressed disinterest in addressing my concerns. He mentioned that he had already instructed the driver to reach out to me and provide a timeframe for the delivery of my package, assuring me that someone would contact me. However, despite the usage of their subpar app, which surprisingly worked on today, I witnessed on thevtravker in the app, the driver making other deliveries in my vicinity and then returning to the warehouse without reaching me. At 6:00, I saw the truck at the warehouse and this compelled me to contact their customer service!! Based on my past encounters, I would not trust them to deliver in a timely manner even if someone's life depended on it.",2024-04-30 06:24:04,US

1,It's been almost 3 weeks. Still no package.,"We had a package shipped to us April 11th from Canada and the shippers site auto corrected our address to the wrong one after entering billing info. When it arrived at the wrong location the tracker says ""The receiver has moved. We're attempting to obtain a new delivery address for this receiver"" which they never once did. I called UPS (our shipper did as well) a total of 23 times and have gotten no real answers. I opened a claim which should 15 days and have 3 left to go. After speaking to an international rep today they said there is nothing I can do. On those multiple calls I changed the address 4x which they said was confirmed. I attempted to schedule a retail pick up nearby 5x to no avail. This company has ZERO organizational skills and should not be operating if they can't keep track of valuable possessions or use common sense like...oh idk... The contact info on the UPS my choice website?? Did the driver steal my package? Did he leave it under the building? How is it just *poof* gone from the system?

I want my package delivered when it's supposed to be delivered and not always delayed for some bogus reason that probably isn't true. The past few orders have been delayed for the same exact reason and this has been back to back without any deliveries actually made on time and when I say on time this has been a period of 7 FULL business days I never get lucky and get my stuff delivered in 3 days or whatever you claim to be able to do. I'd also prefer if customer service didn't pause my chat before I have a chance to even speak with someone about my issue and honestly I wouldn't have as many issues if you guys would update my package location before you decide to delay the delivery one day before it's supposed to be delivered. I'm telling you UPS this time the delay will cost you me unsubscribing from UPSmychoice and attempting to use any other shipping company other than you. Until you get deliveries back on track you've lost a loyal customer and it really sucks to know that no matter what anyone says on here you'll keep doing stuff the same way you're doing it but you need to realize how you started as a company. I understand the workload is a million times over what it was then but 7 days is plenty enough time to deliver something that was shipped from the United States to anywhere else in the United States providing all of the resources you people have. It's so so sad to get on here and see how many of YOUR customers are unhappy and there has been absolutely nothing done about it. You people almost absolutely refuse to refund anyone regardless if it exceeds the 7 day shipping period, sure stuff happens but stuff doesn't happen every single time that I order something or ship something.

They are also fond of informing you last minute (day of) that your delivery will now be delayed by days.  The customer service number they provide makes it next to impossible to speak with a live person (instead try 877-289-6418, but don’t expect them to help resolve issues) and when you are able to speak with someone, they only offer excuses, no resolutions or semblance of customer service (they don’t care, please stop trying to inconvenience them).  This is the same level of customer service I have found in their brink and mortar locations for everything from sending packages, copying, and returning Amazon packages (expect them to require you to make a purchase to accept that return, even when they aren’t supposed to).BEWARE when attempting to do business with UPS.

I'm not even going to have faith anymore, this is clear signs that my package is going to be ""lost"" as the UPS tracking isn't registered despite printed on the damn slip, the scumbag driver probably stole it or threw it in a ditch by now.

UPS delivery is now th worst of all of them, in fact terrible. Their latest packages arrive here before noon, and then take two more days for delivery.  Their tracking shows that packages sit and sit, then show repeated activities.  An example shows location scan one morning, and location scan again the next morning, with delivery scheduled the third day.  UPS employees must not be able to handle such a cumbersome package of 2lbs of coffee beans.  I am not affiliated in any way with any of these services. UPS just sucks, and I feel sorry for any good employee who works for them.  You got your big wage increase and benefits package, but the people who actually pay you, are getting screwed.

On the day of delivery I got an email at 9:30am saying they missed me as I was pulling into my driveway. I called support, explained the incorrect notifications and delivery time and site errors. They told me they'd have dispatch call within an hour. 4-5 hours later they finally called and was somewhat rude. They said they would call me back once they talked to the driver if I could meet him to get my package. No apology or acknowledgement of all the other issues. I asked what I could do about the site error and she said she didn't know but if I couldn't meet them they would try again in two days. So if you aren't following your own window, what am I supposed to do, take off and just wait at home all day? She called back later and said he wouldn't meet me but I could try to catch him and proceeded to give me the most vague descriptions of where he was, saying road names wrong, while she was talking to someone else, and I couldn't tell half the time if she was talking to me or the other person. She said she did that so I could see how it works. So I went to the first area and called her, and she said he's already left and gave me another area. I went there and finally caught him.

1,A Disastrous Experience with UPS,"I recently had an encounter with UPS that left me utterly disappointed and frustrated. I ordered a pair of running shoes from Saucony, who use UPS for their deliveries. My experience was far from smooth, and it was marred by a series of unfortunate events.Firstly, I received a notice that my package was delayed. While I understand that delays can happen, I received this notice twice without any explanation. When I reached out to inquire about the issue, the customer service representative was unable to provide a satisfactory answer. They assured me that I would be notified when the package was shipped, but no such notification came.To my surprise, I found a note in my post box stating that delivery was attempted but unsuccessful because I was not at home. I tried to reschedule the delivery using the “Info notice” number provided. Despite registering on their website, I was unable to make the changes due to constant website crashes. Calls to the hotline were of no help either.The second delivery attempt was also unsuccessful. Instead of sending the package to the nearest access point, they decided to send it back to Saucony. This decision, which seemed to lack any logical reasoning, was extremely upsetting.After another call to the hotline, they agreed to reroute the package to the nearest access point. I went to pick it up two days later, only to be told by the owner of the access point that my package had not arrived, despite the status indicating otherwise.This entire ordeal has been nothing short of a nightmare. The lack of clear communication, the unhelpful customer service, and the unreliable website have all contributed to a terrible customer experience. I am left with no choice but to avoid ordering from vendors that use UPS for their deliveries in the future.In conclusion, my experience with UPS was far from satisfactory. It was characterized by poor customer service, a lack of clear communication, and an unreliable website. I hope that my experience serves as a cautionary tale for others considering using UPS for their delivery needs.",2024-04-15 10:50:20,DE

I decided to pass by and the imbecile left the 3 packages of medication, which all 3 boxes clearly indicate Pharmaceutical, outside the door in public where anyone could've taken it. I ask next door if the UPS guy tried leaving my packages there they said no. I looked at my camaras and he didn't even bother going next door he just left them there and left.

1,"I ordered a walking cane, but got an amazon bubble mailer with art","I ordered a package that was supposed to be delivered today. The image showed a flat item (like in a amazon mailer) when my package should've been at least 4 ft in length. The package I received was supposed to be delivered to a neighbor a few minutes away by car. I called UPS to let them know my package wasn't delivered and I'm in possession of someone else's item. They escalated the case multiple times and told me I would receive a call from a supervisor, but never did. Instead I got an email stating the driver's manifest showed it was delivered. I sent a photo of my neighbor's delivery and was told the driver would return to my residence to give me my delivery. I'm still waiting for the driver, but was given an estimated time frame of 5:30 and it is now 6:00. I will try to call UPS again, but I'm not confident I will get what I ordered back. I may have to try to sell whatever my neighbor ordered just to break even to try and get another walking cane.

1,UPS Canada charges even though they lost the package,"Here is a story you won’t believe. I ordered a book which was supposed to be sent by FedEx but was mistakenly sent by UPS.UPS sent us a bill and then a late fee. We did not receive any package. After 12 phone calls and over 14 hours on the phone, I found out that the investigation which was started 3 weeks ago had been cancelled. The shipment was sent 2.5 months ago and was lost by UPS. No one would admit to UPS losing the package. They then offered to start an investigation again. UPS says that we are responsible for customs and duty charges for a shipment which we did not receive. After asking to speak to a person who could remove our bill, I was told I could not speak to them. I was unable to speak to anyone in Canada. As of now, it is still unresolved. We still owe brokerage fees for a shipment which UPS lost in transit and UPS Canada believes that that is normal. I was told that it would be sent to a collection agent and then my credit score would be harmed until I spoke with someone who said that she would make sure that didn’t happen. I don’t believe that UPS had a safeguard to make sure that we are not sent to collection.UPS CANADA BELIEVES THAT YOU SHOULD BE CHARGED FOR DELIVERIES THAT THEY DO NOT MAKE!!!UPS CANADA DOES NOT BELIEVE IN CUSTOMER SERVICE.UPS CANADA IS A COMPANY THAT IS AMAZING AT BILLING AND REBILLING BUT ARE TERRIBLE AT DELIVERIES.THEY SHOULD BECOME A COLLECTION AGENCY.

The quality of this work force has rapidly deteriorated, as evidenced by drivers whose main motive is to get away as soon as possible before the home owner catches them placing a note on the door.

2,"Dear UPS Management,","Dear UPS Management,I am writing to address a matter of urgent concern regarding the pick-up and delivery services provided by UPS, which are crucial to our operational success. The timeliness and reliability of your services directly influence our ability to meet our customers' expectations for prompt delivery.It has come to our attention that more than 70% of the reviews regarding UPS services are negative. This is a troubling statistic that underscores the immediate need for improvement. Such a significant percentage of unfavorable feedback not only reflects on UPS but also impacts the businesses that rely on your services.The essence of our reliance on UPS is the trust in your ability to deliver packages on time. Unfortunately, recent experiences suggest a disconnect between the service level promised and the service level provided. This inconsistency not only disrupts our operations but also affects our customer relationships and business reputation.We acknowledge the complexities involved in logistics and delivery services. However, the commitment to service excellence must be unwavering. It is essential that UPS addresses these service shortcomings promptly to restore confidence among its clients.Moreover, the importance of thorough and continuous training for UPS personnel cannot be overstated. Such training is crucial not only for enhancing service efficiency but also for ensuring that each team member can uphold and deliver the quality of service that UPS is known to represent.We urge UPS management to take decisive actions to review and enhance your service protocols and training programs. Addressing the concerns reflected in customer reviews and ensuring consistent, reliable service are critical steps toward maintaining and strengthening the trust businesses place in UPS.We are keen to witness and experience the improvements in UPS's service delivery. Our goal is to maintain a productive and positive relationship with UPS, founded on mutual respect and shared dedication to service excellence.Thank you for your attention to this pressing issue.Sincerely,M.C.",2024-04-11 13:45:54,NO

Despite multiple emails, I received no response.In a last resort, I logged into their website and initiated a chat, only to wait for an excruciating 20 minutes before being connected to a representative. The person I spoke with seemed unfamiliar with basic shipping and delivery processes, asking irrelevant questions that only added to the frustration. And then, without warning, the conversation abruptly ended, leaving me without a solution.I'm now left feeling stranded and unsure of how to proceed.

Also said if driver feels it is dangerous or they don’t have the equipment to get a signature.  Can’t a signature be put on a piece of paper?If you can’t deliver to an address, the shipper and their customer should be told that BEFORE you take their money and say you will deliver it.Ethics, integrity.

1,Where is my order,"""I ordered a package on Wednesday night and paid extra for two-day shipping. However, I was informed that my package won't arrive until Monday. To make matters worse, UPS has no idea where my package is, and they have only confirmed that a label was created. I contacted OWC to ask about the situation, and I was informed that paying extra for two-day shipping does not guarantee delivery within two days. also, they think the package is either still in the warehouse or UPS picked it up and hasn't updated their site yet again I ordered this on Wednesday night today is Friday. I know Ups delivers on Saturdays as well but how can Ups deliver something that they don't know where it is, I was already confused when I placed my order, but now I am extremely frustrated and angry. I am even considering asking for a refund because I work on Monday for school, and I won't be home when UPS comes to deliver the package. This only added to my confusion and frustration, as I had assumed that paying extra for expedited shipping would ensure that my package arrived on time. I am extremely dissatisfied with the customer service I received from OWC. The OWC representative I spoke with was unhelpful and did not offer any solutions. As a school employee who works on Mondays, I will not be home when UPS comes to deliver the package. This situation has left me extremely upset,  This entire experience is very upsetting, and I don't think I will shop at OWC again. Despite the affordable price of a M1 Mac mini 16GB for under $600, the poor customer service I received has left me with a negative impression of the company. I hope that OWC will take steps to improve their customer service in the future, as I don't believe I will be shopping with them again. nor will I be recommending them to others. It's very disappointing that a company with a reputation like OWC could fail to provide a positive experience. I would urge them to look into this issue and take the necessary steps to fix it. Ups is no off the hook either the automation call kept hanging up on me and I have no updated from them or how to reach UPS as well ups need to do better I would urge both companies to take immediate action to rectify the issue. They should also ensure that adequate customer service is in place and that customers can easily reach them.

1,A snail forced to carry my package through a salt flat is more dependable,"I have had trouble with UPS with this issue before but I have never said anything until now because it was annoying but I had no proof. Today I have proof and an eyewitness. UPS consistently will say that an attempt was made to deliver a package to my home, but they do not knock on my door. That's fair, I have a dog who is unleashed and likes to bark at delivery drivers. She is small but I understand some people are scared of dogs, so that's fine. Fed-Ex has gotten around this problem easily however. Their driver will either pull partially into my driveway or park on the road and honk their horn a few times and wait a minute or two for me to come out and get my package from them from the truck. Once again, I have no problem whatsoever doing this, as long as the driver doesn't mind seeing me in an oversized sweatshirt, sweatpants, a messy bun, and cat slippers. UPS on the other hand is absolutely deplorable. A snail with my package strapped to its shell and forced to crawl across 10 miles of salt flats would be more dependable than a UPS delivery. UPS will claim to have attempted to deliver a package to my home, but they will not come to the door to knock, they will not come partially onto my driveway, they will not honk their horn more than once (sometimes not at all) and they will not wait more than 15 seconds before they declare my package undeliverable and drive away.

1,Horrible experience with UPS,"Horrible experience with UPS. I used the recovery service faundit to recover some low value personal belongings I left in a hotel. UPS forced onto me a vat form that wasn't applicable to my situation. Along with a signature to agree to 13.8 gbp per work day in storage so they can obtain clearance from UK customs. Called HMRC customs, they said UPS have supplied the wrong form in my situation based on the tracking number. Called UPS, they agreed nothing else to do from my side. Asked to get that in writing via email amd they took down my email but never sent through confirmation. The tracking notification also changed to nothing is required.  Almost a week later I  Called UPS again. Back to square one asking for a vat form, saying I need to complete what they are sending me. Tried to get details. They hung up the phone. No email. I tried to chase both emails and call. They pointed to the form, so I filled it in partially without signing upto 13.8 gbp charge since no one could explain to me why the change from it not being required. About to call them again. Massive disruption to me. I feel held hostage since the belongings include a restricted travel document which is permitted to be sent by post to UK",2024-03-28 15:45:35,GB

UPS can't figure how to open up my gate and put a box by my door versus on the steps where porch pirates can easily get it? I am doing my best to secure my package by having the gate that the UPS driver can easily push open or undo the latch.

I called them and they told me to go back to the UPS store because they couldn’t help me.  I told the representative that she was giving me the run around and then she gave me to another telephone number 1-800-742-5877 to call.  The next person told me that I could not receive a refund because I didn’t specify two day early morning delivery.  No one told me that I needed to do so and when you pay for two day air delivery, that should mean two days no matter what.

No notification of where - just a random surname ""Delivered to Patel"". Gee thanks. Who on earth is Patel?? I had to play super detective to find where it had been left. Now it looks like something similar has happened again - delivery was due by 12pm today, I've been waiting all day and nothing has shown up. Tracking still say's arriving by 12pm today (it's past 4pm as I write this). Honestly it's not even a surprise at this point, I know this will happen. I wish I could ask sellers to send by a different service. Just no. Don't use UPS. Please, just don't.EDIT - they said they'd deliver next day by 12 (that today).

Looking at the tracking, both packages were handled by no less than 5 UPS locations in 4 states (all in east).   What adds insult to injury is they just dump the damaged boxes on the driveway without ringing the doorbell, even though MyUps has instructions to do so.  Furthermore, even after returning one of the boxes, UPS decides to ship it back to the originating location and then turn it around and redeliver it to me!  So that DAMAGED box will have travelled to no less than 20 UPS locations over its fateful journey.  This is just another clear example of leadership with heads in the clouds counting their egregious bonuses and just increasing prices to cover it all up for customers to eventually pay.

As a single parent, it is difficult to determine when I will be around, so I attempted to call UPS to see if I could just meet them at the depot.  Something I had done years ago.  That is when my blood started to boil.  I was caught in a loop of automation.  The automated service kept asking me for my tracking number.  I repeated time over and over again.  It just would not understand my tracking number.  There was no way to get a live person available.  It was a nightmare.  I made mulitple calls, nothing changed.  Finally, I inputted probably 100 zero digits and a live person came on.  This person was on a script and would not deviate.  I was getting angrier by the minute.  My son by my side listening to me get upset at a stupid machine and then a human acting like a machine.  I wanted the product.  I did not want the aggravation.  I let them know but nothing came of UPS.  I then tried the company to find similar script response.  At that point I just told them to keep their product.  I emailed them probably 5 times telling the company the same thing.  I get a response at 11 at night via email.  Same response to multiple emails.  We have lost our customer service relying on automation.  Rather than keep the product that I so desperately wanted and waited for, I have decided to just go to my local electronic store and order there and pick it up when it arrives.  I will have to wait on the credit which was in the thousand before I can make the purchase.  But I make my point whether anyone cares or not.  By the way, the driver today was kind and apologetic.  Not his fault.  It is the company's motto that hurts the worker.  I have always treated my delivery people with mad respect, tipping the ones delivering big ticket items like my sauna and stuff.  Now I am on here to vent my anger to see that UPS has one star as its rating.  I would go less if I could.  I realize none of this will make a difference as one person, but maybe if it continues to happen, and others join in, they will listen and remember that human interaction is still the most valuable tool.  I have used it successfully at our practice, and our customers love us even 30 years later.",2024-03-21 01:05:22,US

Today. it's 9 days later and they still don't know where it is. The 800 number at UPS told me to go back to the store where it was shipped. The store told me all they can do is put in a claim with UPS which I haven't heard squat on. I talked to the owner of the store and told him that, if I told my employee to have something done by tomorrow and he didn't do it, I'd fire him. Guess what?

Where was the disclosure? At no point throughout my order was I informed that the cost of my purchase would double and demand more than the duty fees owed.

She laid the previous customers money on the counter so she won't have to touch him( black male) instead of putting it in his hand as his hand was extended to her to recv his change.

I can’t get a refund for my orders because it’s “on the way”. Party has already passed so I have no use for these items. I cancelled my Amazon membership because of UPS horrible delivery. Amazon doesn’t care tho. Says I can get a refund on the 16th. Package got delayed again today til the 21st and now I have to wait longer lol it’s a joke. What happened to Amazon drivers??

1,Failed UPS Express delivery. Never again.,"UPS Express delivery was a complete disappointment. I had scheduled my entire day around receiving an urgent package, knowing full well that I needed to be present with identification for the delivery. However, there was no attempt by UPS to communicate with me whatsoever. Despite being at home with my cellphone beside me all morning, I received no message, call, or email regarding the delivery status. To my surprise, after checking the tracking information for the umpteenth time, I discovered that UPS had claimed I wasn't available for delivery and intended to redirect the package to a nearby UPS Access Point™. By the end of the day, it still hadn't arrived at this Access Point.This lack of communication and failed delivery attempt is unacceptable, especially for a time-sensitive package. Even after reaching out to customer support, I received no response. This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied with UPS Express service, and I have no intention of using their services again in the future.It's truly disappointing to see such a reputable company handle deliveries in such a careless and irresponsible manner.",2024-03-18 19:14:26,DE
1,lost my package,I have a package to go back to Amazon but it seems ups lost it. The ups app and website indicates that the label was created but nothing else. This is the second package ups lost. I called and the automated assistant checked and said that an agent would not be able to help since there was no other information about this package. I'm out $31.99. The ups driver did not scan the label as soon as I gave it to him. This is the second package ups lost because I believe the driver did not immediately scan the label when I handed him the package. Had I known this I would have insisted he scan the package right then and there. I've been checking every day since and hope it will miraculously appear. Trying to put in a lost package claim is not as simple as it sounds. The last message I get is 'cannot submit claim your account number is not associated with your ups.com profile'. I don't know what account number they are talking about. I doubt the package will get to Amazon in time for them to issue a refund that is if it will ever get there at all.,2024-03-18 18:47:32,US

It's really very simple to find! So the driver was either incompetent or too lazy to even try. I don't know which is worse. Fast forward to the end of the day and I PERSONALLY have to drive our equipment to a drop spot, despite having paid for UPS to pick it up at our adress. Was that the end of our trouble? NO!!! When it was time to ship everything back again, only one package out of two made it back on time. The timing was crucial because we needed the equipment for another fair.

1,What's happened to 'delivery' services,"UPS is either consistently incompetent, or deliberately ineffective. I guess I'm spoiled by Amazon, because they actually deliver.I ordered some products from Ontario, giving myself lots of time for them to get to Vancouver. One flight and 40 minutes drive in heavy traffic. The supplier sent them in a timely fashion and they were slated for delivery a week before I needed them (March 1st). Two days after scheduled delivery, I received an email from UPS saying that my package had been delivered. I was surprised because I hadn't seen it but didn't go back down to the lobby at that time to check the mailroom. An hour later I received another email from them saying I had 'Declined' the package. I checked my phone to see if anyone had even rung my buzzer, and they had not. I called them and they said they would set it up for delivery the following day. Nothing was delivered that, or the following day. The next day I received an email saying it was sent back to the shipper and, oh yay, I could track its route. That was the end of any hope for March 1st.After contacting the shipper, they agreed to send the order again. With UPS? I asked dubiously. Pity. But what were the odds something would go wrong again?Well, I received the email from UPS saying ""Sorry we missed you."" Then I went down to the mailroom and found the ""Sorry..."" doortag on my mailbox. Then I looked at my phone. No calls from the buzzer. So I'm not exactly sure what this means. Does UPS not deliver to apartments? Or do they not know that there are buzzers at the door to contact residents? Or are they not good at reading the part of the address that plainly says Buzzer 1234? Or, really, do they just do this to screw people around ? What could possibly be the excuse?But I guess I should be grateful I was finally able to pick it up today, March 17th.",2024-03-18 06:57:25,CA

I told him I had spoken with the driver, all was good, don't write him up or discipline him ( I was trying to protect the driver, even though he didn't deserve it). Ok. Next driver ""knocked"" so softly I didn't hear him, and I was less than 2 feet away, but he did put my items in the door! Next delivery. Item came early, ok, HOWEVER, the driver came after dark, so my door was locked. Instead of having the sense to knock, he left my item on the sidewalk. His pic shows he didn't follow directions, or he would have knocked. Remember the supervisor said he'd update/correct my preferences. So not on,y did the driver ignore my instructions, he didn't knock, and the item was delivered after dark. I then spent several trusting calls to the UPS bot. I finally went to IM and was told I would ""definitely"" get a call by 1242 next day, CST. None came. I said I had romlewve but gave my email. No email. So I've been totally ignored and blown off.

Apple emailed me saying that I had 1 week to talk to UPS about my package otherwise they would send it back to Apple.

Yesterday it said deliver was going to be delivered between 11:30-3:30 today.  Today I received an update that it would be delivered between 3:45-6:45, even though the website showed by 7 pm both days.  I didn't bother to check until about 2 pm and it showed it had been delivered, complete with a photo.  I opened my front door and there was nothing!  I panicked and looked at the photo again, to realize that it was NOT my front door!  I live in a condo and my until is clearly marked with a number outside my front door.  I ran down the walkway checking all of my neighbors for the large box.  I finally found it 6 doors away!!  I had to lug a huge heavy box back and in my house.  I tried calling UPS and the automated system told me to file a claim and hung up on me twice.  I tried their website and the automated system told me the same thing.  They are horrible.  I will never use them unless there is no alternative!!  I finally replied to the ""your package has been delivered"" no reply e-mail and said NO IT HASN'T.

1,The Decline of UPS,"So, I just got a notice and I was home all day and no one knocked on my door until my neighbor came to my door and knocked and I found the notice. I called corporate  and the 800# which should be renamed to call 1-877- call BOT! All phone numbers for help are transferred to the same program with the same bot, aka artificial intelligence and it is impossible to get a life human person to help and one would think. I remember that when UPS started they had live people to help us and now that they have prospered , yet the quality of service to its' customers, has plummeted to poor and very, I will add.  The link to track also on the notice, will also not work w/o your tracking no. At this now for an hour and hope this helps someone and UPS pays attention to their latest reviews and not just on here. The bot could not help me after spending 1/2 on phone. Pressing 0 no longer works. This shipment w/notice number only could have been any one package from multiple companies that I have order from recently. We used to be able to put the notice number and it would give us the information. I called my Local franchise UPS store and was advised to call and choose shipping rates and then put the notice number to get a live person but also she looked it up for me and gave me my tracking no. Why put us through more hardships UPS after you have become so successful! Fix this and make it easy for us to speak to a live person;  my heart goes out to the Elderly on this as well!! Any delivery services out there in competition, never make this mistake and LQQK I am sure customers will pay whatever just to get the help they need Live and not from a BOT or Robot; and be able to easily access a Human Being for Service!.",2024-03-09 01:08:45,US
1,Well I emailed UPS on their email…,"Well I emailed UPS on their email address (which they don't go out of their way to publicise!), and have had no response, so I assume that they probably don't care; something apparently reflected by the numerous other reviews here, so here is a slightly edited (for clarity) version of my email:As you (hopefully!) know, I received a package shipped to me from Spain to the UK.There were several problems with the delivery! Especially for a company that I believe ostensibly believes that it is 'international'?!First of all, I would really have liked a 'If no answer, please deliver to...' option. But no, only an alternate address. Why is this?Your 'Delivery Accommodations' is very US-language: In the UK, 'Delivery Options' would be much more recognisable.Your date formatting when showing current delivery-date (and, IIRC, preferred delivery-date) is (again) US-centric. You could at least format it to the locale of delivery, or at least display it in the less ambiguous day/month-name/year format e.g. 4 Feb[ruary] 2024!I was asked for my 'phone number, and your system doesn't seem to support UK mobile-format numbers (I tried with and without +44 and suppressed leading-zero). I didn't try a landline number since I don't have one (at least in the UK, this is becoming more prevalent). I ended up just putting in something that would allow it to pass!I arranged for delivery on a different date (though I would have preferred the 'If not answer...' option above). This was acknowledged, but it was then delivered on the original date anyway?!The shipping/package was marked as 'Requires signature' (so therefore I was obviously keen to ensure someone was in to sign for it, hence changing the delivery!) and it was marked as 'Signed by: LETTERBOX'!And then, to cap it all, your 'email' page (i.e. www DOT ups DOT com SLASH upsemail SLASH includeForm) doesn't seem to work correctly when I choose 'General' support category, there's no option to proceed! :o(And I couldn't write or even paste in all of the above text, which is why I'm emailing this address!>>> So, in summary, in the future, I'll be asking companies 'Who do you use to ship?', and if it's 'UPS', it'll be a 'No [way pedro]!' from me, and I'll shop elsewhere!:o(",2024-03-09 00:19:47,GB

Called at 7pm they said oh no it is not out for delivery. This is just my experience for today. This experience has repeated itself many times. Totally useless service, totally inaccurate info, Customer service ? What's the point in calling them they fix nothing and give you bad info. They have no respect to customers or their wasted time waiting for the driver to show up. Many times driver would report business closed on tracking  and the driver never even showed up at the door.

I had been at home waiting all afternoon and I had received no indication that UPS was here. I phoned Customer Service. I got through after only three minutes wait -- so I guess that rates the one star I have to give. In any case, I told the rep that the directory buzzer on the apartment building rarely works and that delivery people have to phone me when they arrive. This has been accomplished successfully (several times) with Canada Post, FedEx, Amazon and Purolater. The rep said their drivers don't have a cell phone. I said ridiculous, everyone has a cell phone these days. He said they are not issued one by the company. The rep then suggested that tomorrow I watch for the delivery driver and get the parcel from him. Since this is an apartment, that would mean waiting in the lobby for up to four hours in case the driver arrived. I said no. The rep then asked me if I would be able to pick the package from from their facility. It turned out that facility is in a different city. I said no. The rep then suggested that I have  the package  delivered to a different location. Since my friend would be willing to accept packages for me, I said yes that would be fine. Then  the rep told me that there would be a fee charged for changing the address. At this point, I lost my temper. I cannot imagine being asked to pay a fee because their drive isn't able or willing to notify me when he is there. I said no and instructed them to return the package to the shipper. I will make other arrangements to retrieve it. I consider this appalling customer service and from now on, I will not order from businesses who are using UPS to deliver.",2024-03-06 06:07:53,CA

I was also told 3 attempts on specific days were made, but not once did I get a call or email or doorbell ring and I was home all those days. Because I was unable to pick up my package at the access point, my parcel is now being returned to sender as ""undeliverable"".

Drivers are incompetent, Customer Service incompetent, Management incompetent.That should be a use case on how to run a worst business",2024-03-05 11:03:56,IE
1,Theft and Fraud,"Oh boy where to start. I would give UPS 0 stars if I could. Several months back I had sold expensive shoes and dropped them off at a local UPS Store location. They were immediately stolen, and done so before the package was marked “received” by the store. So after trying for hours to show proof of a drop receipt that matched the tracking number and date I was told that there was no way for them to verify if the package was received EVEN THOUGH I CLEARLY HAD A VALID DROP OFF RECEIPT. I lost hundreds of dollars instantly with no recourse. Some employee at that store definitely banked on the fact that the corporation has absolutely abysmal customer service and knew that I wouldn’t win any dispute I tried against them, even though I had 100% valid proof of dropping the package. UPS is like a toddler that did something bad - unwilling to take responsibility even though the proof is right there.Then months later I began receiving invoices for packages I never shipped, to addresses I have never seen in my life. Two of these were fraudulently charged to my card, forcing me to get on the phone with the bank and try to get my money back while changing cards to ensure whoever had my info couldn’t charge my account anymore. As to be expected UPS has no service or method of dealing with fraud, so now I have no idea if these fraudulent invoices will keep racking up late fees and/or affect my credit. Their customer service line doesn’t even let you speak with a real person, so I have no way of addressing this beyond filing a dispute which most likely will be denied, just like my lost package claims.This company is a dumpster fire. Don’t waste your time or risk your hard earned money dealing with this trash corporation. UPS employees will steal your stuff and fraudulently charge you hundreds of dollars with the tacit support of the company.",2024-03-05 00:02:20,US
1,Terrible,Terrible. I ordered a watch. They couldn’t post it to my door as I was out. They then told me I had to sign up to the ups app to change my delivery date. I signed up and now I can’t change it anyway.,2024-03-04 17:13:34,GB

1,"Do not ship with UPS if you value your time, mental health, and money","While I have never left a negative review in my life, I feel the need to share about UPS.  I honestly do not know how they remain in business.  That is the honest truth.  The fact that they have 1 point something stars for reviews makes perfect sense based on how they operate business-wise.  I have had so many packages completely destroyed by UPS.  It shows that they have zero regard for trying to honour their customers and treat their packages with care and respect.  The crazy amount of effort it takes to get things like this resolved is also sadly very mind-boggling.  I have just given up on getting reimbursed on most packages of mine that were damaged.  One package I dealt with them on the phone, different departments, through email, etc. for probably 7 hours and I just gave up in the end and lost out on $500.  Their customs brokerage charges are also ridiculously high when crossing the border to Canada.  They will charge customs charges of $42 CAD on a shipment that is $110 USD.  In what world is it ok to charge somebody $42 for basically a paper shuffle on an item that is worth $110 USD?  When dealing with customer service on the phone, it is by far the worst and most frustrating company I have ever talked to on the phone, bar none.  I have literally given up on UPS, but the odd time people send me a package through UPS (without my knowing), more often than not it is a complete disaster (unless it is a very short shipment in distance).  Please, if you don't have to deal with UPS, do not ship with them.  UPS you need to get better on how you treat your packages.  Also please stop charging people crazily high customs charges.  You are losing many customers due to your very poor business practices.",2024-03-03 04:06:25,CA

I'm willing to get in my vehicle on a saturday and drive over there and pick it up. I can't talk to a person the eight hundred number is a robot. There is a alternate number with live people. But that numbers only man monday through friday. The letter could have been mailed. Standard US postal service and got here. Quicker but it was a time sensitive matter and was sent out overnight. You would think the company would make every effort to get it overnight letter that has been bouncing around your system for days to us. Not so they have no sense of urgency. Use other services like fedex. I'm a business owner and 90% of my stuff. Either comes US postal service or FedEx. It used to be UPS the service is degenerated. It amazes me that companies like DHS Can get overnight shipments from asia to me. U p s can't get a letter overnight to me from boston. Worse service ever.,2024-03-02 16:58:21,US

1,UPS don't care if you are sexually harassed in one of their drop off locations and think you should return to the store it happened in to report it instead of them.,"I went in to send off a UPS parcel around 3.20pm. When I got into the shop the person behind the counter was having a video call with another male. They were speaking in another language. I was asked to enter my phone number on a device to send my parcel off and when I had done this I looked up and saw the person behind the counter pointing his phone camera at me. It was quite clear that he was saying things about me in another language and showing this person what I looked like/recording me. As soon as the person realised that I had noticed they quickly withdrew their phone. At the time I didn't feel comfortable enough to say anything as I was alone, but I have reported it to TVP and have tried to speak to UPS, who advised I go back to the store that it happened in to report this as they only drop off and pick up parcels from this location. I'm really disappointed with their advice as I thought they would take a complaint of this kind quite seriously.",2024-03-01 01:08:04,GB
1,Waste of time,"I would like to say frist that I am a small business owner of 18 years . I have not seen a more Inefficient company then the U.P.S. From the way the automated system that does not work or can not recognize my voice, or to the inability to receive help from a actual person when needed or the  poor customer service that i received.  As a small business owner that has to navigate today's crazy economy and the day to day operations of my business i dont need this on my plate.  When i waste so much time and i do not getting anywhere or do not receiving any help it becomes so frustrating to me . This is not fair to me, to my employees or my customers.   U.P.S. needs to be radically redone from the ground up when it comes to customer service. This is why I will not do business with them. The reviews on so many  other platforms  show they do not care . Please do not give some half wit response that you (U.P.S.) do not even believe in.  JUST CHANG YOUR WAYS",2024-02-29 23:31:21,US

1,"Useless Parcel ""Service""","Received a tracking number from the retailer but no communication from UPS.  The tracking web page just showed that the package had been received but there was no indication when it would be delivered to me.  I assumed, correctly, the next day, when I was likely to be out but there was no option to ask for the parcel to be left in a safe place at my property or with a neighbour.  When I got home, I found a slip saying it had been taken to a UPS Access Point - not the one nearest to me (walkable).  I went to the web page to arrange for it to be moved to my local Access Point.  I've just checked (more than 24 hours later) to read ""On the way!""  I'd stupidly assumed that the package would be moved directly from one address to the other but it seems it has gone back to the depot, so goodness knows when it will reach the local Access Point.

Frustration#1_ Okay I need to download and install ""UPS My Choice"", I'm okay with installing the app and setting up the account if their system would let me. The fact that my email address and password were unique wasn't sufficent. I had to reenter info until I found a unique user name as well. Then I still wasn't successful at setting up the account because their system informed me that my street address was invalid. My street address is what it is!                  Frustration#2_ I called UPS Customer Service. The automated system kept telling me I was not providing a valid tracking#. After three attempts, rather than connecting me to a representative, the answering system said ""Please call back when you have a tracking number. Goodbye.""Next I called and stated I wanted to file a complaint. English was not the native language of the customer service representative I was connected to. I think I was told that the only way to change a delivery address was: 1. if the current delivery address was the same as the home address UPS has on file for me.     ""?""               I repeated this back to the rep to clarify if I understood this and she said that that was correct; OR  2. I could call the sender (in this case, Amazon) and ask them to contact UPS and change the delivery address. Recommendation for improvement:Make it easier for your customers to talk with a another human rather than a computer.Modify the ""My Choice"" app to allow customers to enter their address wheather your system thinks its valid or not. I was rather surprised when I entered 1946 Street name, town, and zip code and then have the UPS system tell me this was an invalid address.TEST YOUR SYSTEM before offending your customers with it!",2024-02-28 01:13:33,CA

I did that exactly how I have been told being told to ignore certain fields (I did fill the form while UPS person guiding me and double checked everything with them) Just to receive an email saying that the form is missing information  about what I have been told to ignore by UPS.3rd after many days and hours on phone with dozens of advisors who kept transferring me 100 times I finally got the duty to be paid as £221 while the goods only costed me £190 so they basically asking over 105% of the cost of the goods!! what an extortion and scam!4th  I immediately disputed this with them and have been told that they will call me in the morning to discuss the dispute.

After spending hours over 2 days to make a correction using both the ""My Choice"" website and the customer service number, I was unsuccessful in making the corrections I needed and was unable to reach a customer service representative.  The bot was unhelpful and I requested a live chat, that didn't work, I requested a call and when I answered it hung up on me.  This is seriously the worst customer service ever.I will say our driver is the BEST. He even said that if I had been able to get a live person, it's likely that they wouldn't speak English, customer service is non-existent.",2024-02-23 14:26:33,US
1,UPS disregarded the original delivery address,"Instead of the delivery address specified in the tracking, my package was arbitrarily delivered to a UPS Access Point 20 kilometers away.The front door of the originally specified delivery address is an area monitored by a camera, and it can be proven that the UPS courier did not deliver a package to the specified address. But not even according to the tracking.Only the name of a city was given as the place of delivery, neither zip code, street name, nor house number was included in the tracking.I initiated an investigation into the matter, in response to which they revealed the full address. Since then, they have not given an explanation as to why my package was not delivered to the specified delivery address, nor have they apologized or promised a new delivery date. They have been ignoring me ever since.Unfortunately, this was not the first such case, unfortunately it is my experience that the delivery address is ignored in many cases, and the package is delivered wherever they like.The shop I bought from is in contact with several shipping companies, and I will let them know that my next order should not be sent by UPS.",2024-02-23 14:09:28,NL

1,Avoid ever using UPS. Worst service I ever encountered.,"I want to share our unfortunate experience with a recent purchase we made in mid-December. We ordered a small package priced at R699, expecting a smooth delivery process. However, to our dismay, on January 23rd, UPS requested an additional R1219 payment from us. Since then, despite numerous calls to UPS, we have encountered nothing but delays and excuses.Each time we inquire about our package, we receive the same response: it's undergoing inspection, which supposedly takes five working days, and we're assured that we'll receive it by the following Monday. However, several Mondays have passed, and we're still stuck in the same frustrating cycle.It's evident that this company's service is deeply flawed, if not outright deceptive. We believe it's essential to warn others about our experience and urge them to avoid using this company altogether. There are plenty of reputable alternatives available, and we strongly advise against subjecting yourself to such appalling service. Please, learn from our mistake and choose a more reliable provider.",2024-02-22 13:04:57,ZA

Filed a claim thru UPS:still no response. Contacted UPS again today, customer service agent advised me that my package will arrive at my old address that I moved out of 1 year ago. Once again, Advised of correct address : but probably will be a fail.  Wow, really? Should I go knock on some stranger's door demanding my package?  What  THE HELL is going on here? 90% of customer service agent's seem to speak English, without comprehension. Still waiting for my package, not even sure I need the contents, after a month wait.

I was informed that the package would be delivered the next day, February 14th. Knowing how poor and unprofessional UPS drivers can be, I sat at home and literally kept my phone with me, expecting either a call or someone to ring the intercom. At 10:36 am, I received a message that the driver had attempted to deliver my package but failed to contact me... I spent about 30 minutes getting through to customer support where the agent told me that the driver would return to my address and attempt to deliver the package again. Of course, that didn't happen. I told him if it's possible to leave it at a pickup location, and I would go get it; he said no problem. Around 3:00 pm, I called customer service again and chose the option for them to call me back when it was my turn, but nobody called me. At 3:49 pm.I called again and spoke with an agent who told me that the driver could not come back because he had already been to the address once and that someone from the Malmö terminal would call me. No one called me, I did not receive the package, nor do I know where it is or how and when I can pick it up.

Damaged noted I went to a cabinet shop and had repairs made which cost me another $100 for glass and wood touchup. I had to make these repairs immediately as the memorial service was the following day. Now UPS will not even pay the minimum $100 insurance coverage due to me. Picture of the damages was provided.

They wanted to give me a phone number to try and contact the local facility. I told them I would not do their job a that I was very disappointed in their service.  I also cannot properly care for my medical issue without these supplies.  She then hung up on me.  UPS has fallen so far from their glory days.",2024-02-06 18:29:05,US

I dispatched a used iPhone to my mother in Nigeria in response to her deteriorating phone due to illness. Upon the phone's arrival in Nigeria, UPS demanded a payment of more than 200,000 Naira for charges that I have yet to trace. Furthermore, I have no idea where the money went, and my mother never even saw the phone I sent. They insisted that I remit the 200,000 Naira in exchange for the device's return to me in the United Kingdom. This represents the pinnacle of Wick.

1,DO NOT USE UPS,"DO NOT USE UPSI am posting this again because I still have not had a proper response, and I do not want my complaint to be buried by time.I bought a second-hand printed item from Europe, and the import was fraught with trouble. First UPS gave me no information about the delivery; then when I rang up I received inaccurate information from someone who did not understand what I was asking; then I received inaccurate information via the UPS website (which told me the package would be delivered on a certain date -- it was not -- then said it would be delivered the next day -- it was not). I requested more information by e-mail, twice, and finally received a call from someone who told me that the package had been held pending the payment of custom duties and a fee. This was the first I had heard of this. There should have been no duties on this item, as the import of printed matter is not taxable. UPS tried to extort this money from me, and also from the sender. At this point the sender requested the return of the item. This took a long time, but has now been achieved. I had further responses from customer services which showed that they did not understand what I was complaining about and, although they tried to get the customs charges waived, this failed and I continued to receive demands for payment, despite the printed item having now been returned to the sender (and sent to me quickly and without problems by another courier). Then UPS intimidated the sender until he paid the extortionate fee! I re-imbursed him, because none of this was his fault. It was down to UPS who bullied a bookseller into paying more than 200 Euros for customs charges which were not due, on a package which they did not deliver. DO NOT USE UPS!",2024-02-05 14:13:26,GB

P2G advised UPS to return to their office instead of my address - 1st strike.Meanwhile, I was notified that the parcel went missing - 2nd strike. After a week, they found it, and a day later, they lost it again. Summarizing it was lost. P2G customer service was hopeless, and UPS was not supportive as the sender is P2G.The best part I leave to last. Insurance tried to reject my claim, as you could expect. They don't accept the market value of the items, and I didn't insure for the total value. I left it at that point. A year later, all my items appeared on eBay for sale. I tried to report it to the police several times, and they finally accepted it.

1,Utter shambles!,"That old cliche: If I could give minus stars I would. I'm still waiting for a package from Germany that set off a week ago Jan 24th. It was on the move from day one and I thought - excellent. However, it moved about 40 miles and then sat at one of their facilities going nowhere with no tracking updates for 3 days. It finally arrived twice in the UK on Monday. One arrival courtesy of a flight - the second? Who knows. Anyway, tracking estimated it would be delivered that day, Jan 29th. It wasn't. That then changed overnight to January 30th. Again... it wasn't. Now, their estimated delivery date is to be advised as I write with no explanation given. I wonder do they know how infuriating such cavalier behaviour towards customers is? I doubt it and reading all these 1-stars, I doubt if they could give two hoots. But despite the diabolical service and obfuscation, I think I am unravelling the mess without their assistance.I live in Berkshire. They sent my package to their Tamworth depot where it's now been sitting for 40 hours plus. Again - no tracking update. I had the shipper chase them today and it's meant ""to be on the move soon"". But 6 hours since that was promised and it's still at Tamworth, with the latest tracking update now almost 48 hours old. I guess it's coming to Berkshire overnight but still no estimated delivery date though the shipper believes it could be tomorrow Feb 1st or Friday 2nd.In a world where, sadly, the words service and communication mean next to nothing, this experience plumbs new depths.

However, when my package arrives there is no corrections to the label. No new label over the top and my complete address is correctly written on the label. If I try to call I never reach a person. The system that answers requests the tracking number, no matter how many times I repeat it or even call from a different phone it says it doesn’t understand.

Called the customer service and they said they never got the note. Asked to leave the note again and the customer service person said the driver should call me next time. 2nd time, no call again. This time I called and they said that drivers aren't allowed to make phone calls! Then, the customer service person recommended they deliver to a pickup location that was ""0.1 miles away"" from my house. The location he suggested was 35 miles away. I said no, just deliver to my house and call the flat with the intercom by the front door of the apartment complex. The next time, they failed to deliver again and the NEW excuse was that I had given them ""the wrong delivery address"". This is an inexcusable, blatant LIE as I had not changed the address one time since ordering and they'd already been here twice to ""attempt"" delivery so either they lied about trying to deliver the first two times or this excuse is just a lie. Now, their email asks me to update my address information, but when I go to do it, it states that I cannot update the address information for this order! The next delivery attempt is going to be tomorrow and i suspect they're going to fail to do it again. Absolutely horrible experience. 12 days late on a delivery that was meant to be a birthday gift for my partner. Customer service is horrible and their drivers are lazy.

1,Astonishingly Poor Service,"It is astonishing how poor the customer service from this mainstay has become since the pandemic.  It is practically impossible to reach a human though their convoluted automated system (I suspect this is intentional), and when you finally do, the agent can't help anyway, and usually there is a significant language barrier compounded by patchy international telecom connections.  Transit times have bumped up a day over the course of the past year or two, deliveries have been later in the day, and pickups have been super early or skipped.The drivers are (well-compensated) pros and the people at the local hub front desks and office stores are generally great to work with.  The rot is at the corporate level (as is traditional for megalithic institutions).Not once in many years have I had a damage claim approved, so we stopped paying for useless ripoff coverage for over-$99 shipments. There was a massive fraudulent charge to our account in June of 2023 and I am still chasing bill credits in January of 2024!  They continue to generate new return shipment charges and service fees for this KNOWN fraud.  The response from their billing and fraud departments has been very little and not satisfactory at all.  I am not convinced anyone has actually read any of my emails because all I get back are canned responses that dodge or ignore my inquiries.  I have invested hours upon hours doing frustrating accounting calculations for them, just trying to get our money back!After decades as a customer of UPS, we have permanently switched all inbound and outbound shipments to FedEx (unless the customer provides a UPS shipper number) and I highly recommend that all small businesses do the same.  FedEx has been responsive and proactive during the onboarding process, a stark contrast that proves it CAN BE DONE.  Deliveries and pickups are on time.  When I called, I never had a problem getting a person with answers and authority.I feel like we are being punished for bothering UPS.  Competency crisis on parade!",2024-01-26 19:06:17,US

This instruct the drivers to deliver all items to the front porch. Lately all deliveries by UPS have been taken to the garage which is 75 feet away from the house. The driver had to drive past the house to get to the garage. the last straw for me was in December there was a delivery that needed to come to the house. Since the driver went past the house and took it to the garage, my husband tried to get his attention to let him know to bring it to the house. The driver thought it would be a good idea to cuss my husband out when he was asked to bring the package to the house. I have contacted UPS several times regarding the driver's behavior and twice after being told someone will contact me no one has as of today. Going forward if I order anything I have to verify who the carrier is going to be because i will never use UPS again. Unfortunately, there is a package coming today. When I checked on MyUPS I see where the delivery location has been changed to garage. No one in my family has requested and the shipper does not know I have a garage, so this is a flaw on UPS side which they are aware of it.

I'm so proud of their CEO'S hard job and responsibility to direct and guide their company workers for doing an outstanding job performances. They're doing from unbelievable believable! What's happening with UPS is unacceptable, unbelievable, stressful, frustrating and painful. Many families are waiting for their medicine or medical supplies to be delivered, Others, like me are waiting for my pet's medicine and other important packages. But days after days I'm receiving the same disrespectful message, fulling people, deceiving people with lies. I neeed my 4 packages, others too! So, please  CEO do your job and please take a full responsibility into your hands. Force your workers to do their jobs correctly, because now your UPS company is a complete mess! Thank you for reading my complaint and maybe, I'm hoping I will be herd.",2024-01-24 15:26:46,US
1,I wish I could give 0 stars,"I wish I could give 0 stars. There hasn't been a single instance when UPS delivered on time. Every time, they follow the same pattern: on the expected delivery date, nothing happens. The next day, you have to check the tracking page yourself, only to find that they claim an unsuccessful delivery attempt. After updating the address, it appears as if the delay is caused by the address change initiated by the customer. I've had deliveries to different addresses in the city center, and I'm confident that the sender provided the correct address and phone number. Their actions seem designed to conceal a high rate of delays and shift the blame onto the customer.Furthermore, UPS's behavior results in parcels being in transit for a week, even when the initial estimate was 1-2 days. For instance, if you place an order on Monday and the sender ships the parcel the next day, the UPS system indicates delivery on Thursday. However, following their typical pattern, nothing happens on Thursday. You contact them on Friday and hope your parcel arrives on Monday due to the weekend. Does that sound like a 2-day delivery?They could simply specify a 1-week delivery time from the start, but instead, they try to create the illusion of fast delivery, making their mediocre services appear more expensive. In my opinion, this is the worst international delivery company. I wish they would disappear from the face of the Earth.",2024-01-24 14:16:41,CZ

UPS has 7 scans between 12/23 and 1/18 that they have transferred my package to the PO. PO says they’ve never received it.

It was a bald-faced lie.I called UPS after the third time my $2,000 package was out for delivery but went back to the hub, waited over 30 minutes on hold, then talked to a 'CS Agent' *who had a baby loudly crying into the phone!* She was beyond rude, and hung up on me.In a last ditch effort to get the package that I paid exorbitantly for, I went to UPS.com to just pick it up myself. The package is in my city's only UPS distribution center, and this center has a customer service counter attached. UPS.com said that me using *my gas, my car, and my time* would result in my package NOT BEING AVAILABLE TO BE PICKED UP FOR THREE BUSINESS DAYS. The package is literally 100-300 feet from the CS counter! Three business days.I worked at UPS for years, and it's almost unbelievable, how bad this company is now. I will never voluntarily choose UPS as my package carrier again in my life. -10/10",2024-01-17 05:44:05,US

1,Appalled at UPS delivery service.,"Was waiting for a package from Walmart by UPS. I was sitting near my front door waiting cause I was tracking it. I saw UPS drive up and saw him walk up to side of house between house and my car. So when he walking back to his truck I went outside and grabbed my package. Noticed it was open on one end and nothing inside but invoice was in it. Called Walmart and UPS. UPS WAS NO HELP. Never eventalked to anyone. Transferred from one department to another. Surprise surprise. I can always get a refund what I cant believe was the delivery guy delivering an empty box. That makes me madder than anything. I can ask Walmart for credit, refund or resend. I noticed he didn't come to front door he snuck around the side of my house by my car. Wondered why but brushed it off. I have a ring doorbell. He never came near it. I am livid that he dropped off an empty open box. Nice training",2024-01-17 00:41:42,US
1,AVOID - Liars,"I have been waiting for a delivery from Lenovo which I ordered on 2/12/23. Firstly, the item was ‘stuck’ at UPS depot since 18/12/23, after phoning Lenovo on 28/12/23 the item was out for delivery on 29/12/23. On 9/1/24 at 11.29pm I received a text message to say the item can’t be delivered as address in correct. I phoned Lenovo a week later on 15/1/24 (hoping they will re attempt the delivery)  and advised my address to which I have lived at for 18 years is correct. Lenovo advised they will contact UPS. Today 16/1/24 at 11.11am I received another text, the tracking now states ‘delivery refused’. At 11.16am I once again phoned Lenovo who asked me to contact UPS. Phoned UPS at 11.25am who told me the item has been disposed off as no one contacted them. Apparently the driver tried to deliver on 20/12/23 and as they had no response so they will return the item to the sender. The tracking information differs to what I was told. So who is lying? The driver? The customer service representative? Or both?I was told I couldn’t speak to a manager as the item has already been sent back.

Well 1 month later I get a paper invoice that says I should ship them a cheque to pay the bill, and that late fees are accruing as of 2023-12-28, but I got the invoice 2024-01-12. Also who the hell writes cheques (not to mention mailing it back at their expense?).Finally I call them, just to clear the billing issue and prevent any further package delivery issues to my delivery address. Well the number on the bill isn't for billing, and I had to get transferred. Then when checking if they could reduce the bill to 20.14 CAD, they f****n hung up on me. I call billing again (get the US billing), have to call a new number, ask to reduce the bill back to 20.14 CAD. No they refuse!!!

1,UPS is just the worst,"UPS is just the worst. I get deliveries to my house all the time, and they never arrive at the same time. Just in the last week, I've had (2) packages that require a signature. The first delivery was attempted on a Friday at 1:30. I wasn't home, and it had said it was supposed to be delivered Saturday for a week, otherwise I would have made arrangements to be home. They didn't attempt to deliver the next day, so I changed to be picked up at a local UPS store. When I got to the store (after receiving an email that my package was ready for pickup) they couldn't find it, and said it had never been there. The package was lost, and I couldn't file a report online, as it said I'd have to call the help line. The help line wouldn't allow me to file a report or speak to a representative, that wasn't a robot. Worse than that, it says my package was left at ""Residential"" (no address) and signed for by Lyon. There is no one by that name at my address, and the UPS store had no one by that name on thei payroll. I ended up having to contact the company I bought the product from, and luckily they were very helpful and got it all sorted with a replacement package. On to this week, when delivery was attempted on a Thursday, at 2PM, and another notice was left that they'd attempt today. So today I made arrangements to be home, expecting them to deliver at about the same time. I signed the notice, and left it on the door as instructed, but also put a note to call, with my number if I don't answer, stating that I am home. at about 2, I thought, ""oh this is the same time they attempted delivery yesterday, let me go hang out outside for a bit, just in case."" As I looked out the front window, I saw a UPS truck pulling away. I heard no knock, and there was no additional notice on the door. I grabbed my shoes and keys, and went to chase them down, because I can't afford to miss another day of work for their nonsense, but they'd already gotten out of sight, and I couldn't determine which direction they went.

I’ve e-mailedthem three times and not had any reply, I’m guessing they just know that eventually most people will just give up. And this latest one was with a package I was expecting. Got a message that it was in at a different drop off point just in case they were right but it wasn’t there. I asked at the shop if this happens often and the reply I got was at least once a week with ups, and sometimes people just don’t get their packages.

1,nightmare,"I'm not sure what words to use to explain how bad this company is.I'm relocating from Italy to Sweden, I shipped 4 packages of 25kg each with my belongings in 2 different dates.2 on 6th December, 2 on 13th December.the first 2 arrived in mölndal day 12th, I requested a delivery for day 18th because I would arrive in Sweden day 15th.1 package was delivered day 14th, ignoring my request, left outside my apartment door, thank God it was still there when I arrived at 11PM of the 15th. It was completely broken, also some items inside were broken.2nd package was never delivered. from 18th to day 20th was scanned everyday and never delivered. From that day I lost track of it, tracking never updated anymore.And here is where the worst started, i called UPS assistance multiple times per day, in a single day I got the following answers:- your package will be delivered tomorrow (day 22)- your package was requested to be delivered on day 26th ( note that, day after christmas! like someone is working that day)- your package is 25kg and we don't deliver this kind of package, it is with bring.I got a call from someone (no idea who it was or from where) that explained to me that heavy packages are delivered from Bring and not from UPS.Note that at this point I had already received the other 2 packages, so a total of 3 packages of the same weight were already delivered.I asked how to contact this bring, they couldn't answer me.I understood that this was just a lie.I kept calling and calling, always different answers, I felt talking with someone who had this job since 2 days.Finally they open a claim for finding the package because it was not scanned since days; on day 27th I received an email explaining that they couldn't locate my package, and to write in details what was inside to open a refund claim.I sent them all the details as requested, didn't hear anything from them.On day 30th the package is getting scanned in mölndal again, I call AGAIN the support, at least 3 times, and get 3 different answers:- you just opened a claim so you have to wait 10 working days- someone gonna call you (didn't 't happen)- it will get delivered soonFrom this point, I get daily the message that it got scanned, and that's it, never attend a delivery.And now the comic part, yesterday I go check and it says that package is on the way BACK to the sender.guess what? I contact support that tells me they can't give out information due to privacy, when I'm the sender.Right now my package is in Denmark, heading back to Italy, where there is NONE at that address.I hope my parents can call the local UPS and get it for me from their warehouse, if not, this package will be delivered to an empty house.I'm upset, disappointed and disgusted for this service.I paid almost 150€ for 4 packages, this one contained all my clothes, I arrived in Sweden with only the clothes I was wearing, had to buy everything back.Customer service is made of incompetent people and drivers don't follow instructions, because I paid for floor delivery, while the driver left the last 2 packages OUTSIDE my building door, I had to carry 50kg on 2 floor stairs with no elevator.I'm fuming thinking I will have to ship another 2 or 3 packages in the next months that my parents are holding for me.worst experience ever.EDIT:9th January. package arrived in Italy, where none claimed. I received a mail from UPS saying that the day expired so it was shipped bad to sender. and now the funny part: because they didn't know my address in Sweden, and i didn't leave any email for phone number and poor them they couldn't get in touch with me.I CALLED 35 TIMES, LEFT MY PHONE NUMBER 35 TIMES, LEFT MY EMAIL 35 TIMES AND HAD TO CONFIRM MY ADDRESS ALL 35 TIMES. i fill up a complaint with all details, sender and receiver, even what was inside the package, item by item. And you f**king lie saying you didn't know how to contact me?F**king incompetent company, you all should just get fired and go pick up tomatoes, a more suitable job.

Last month I finally went out to my street and explained to the driver this is needed medication and I work from home and to please come to the door. He said he wouldn't because of the dogs (note, my dogs are in the backyard, not the front yard where my front door is). So I told him I'd buy another doorbell camera and put it at my gate. He said that would be great! $90 later, doorbell camera installed and guess what! He came in the driveway, honked (which I didn't hear) and left the notice literally inches away from the doorbell I specifically installed for them, and DIDN'T ring the bell!!!!!!!!!! UGH!!!!!!!!

I checked my emails and can see I clearly did and even have a reply from the member of staff confirming they have received it. I have now submitted the information again. I then called customer service to put in a compliant, they transferred me to customs, customs then transferred me back to customer service. I asked to speak to a manager, manager refused (claimed to be busy). I tried to put in a compliant and request a refund or some compensation as this will now be the forth time my parcel is late (meant to be delivered by yesterday). But all she kept saying was ""we're really sorry about that, I will have customs contact you to get the additional information required for clearance"". Even though I already explained that he information has already been sent. It's like talking to a robot built in the 90's, that doesn't understand English very well. Is there an English department for Customs I can talk to, as I can't deal with the Indian call centre anymore, nothing ever gets done and I'm having to spend hours for every delivery, chancing up it's progress.

Not only is the UK customer service absolutely useless, but they lost 2 out of my 5 boxes shipped! The fact that their websites did not work properly and I have little to no documentation of shipment should have been a warning sign, but I figured they are a trustworthy company. They could not even find two huge boxes, locate them, or send somebody with the tracking number to track them down in their warehouse. It is easier for them to reimburse your shipping cost and be done. Never mind the true loss you encountered, which no insurance in the world would truly be a comfort for, anyway, even IF their website had worked properly.",2023-12-30 22:39:19,GB

There is no way we can get the internet connection and get/show the UPS return QR code to ship the package.  This UPS store is still in the third World Country and making a huge profit by way of not providing any basic thing and all they care is money.

However, in few hours the parcel is delivered to the fraud address.

When i went outside to call UpS customer Service the 'Manager' followed me outside and listned to my phone call with UPS Customer Service intentionally.

1,UPS Refuses to Deliver My Packages (Which I have delivered because I am handicapped and rarely leave the house) They Insist That I Pick Them Up At Their Warehouse,"Once again I’m getting a go round from UPS. This holiday season Amazon gave them some of my packages to deliver to me. Now I am elderly and handicapped and do not drive. I live in an apartment and get many of my essentials including food from Amazon who delivers to my door. I am home 99% of the time. UPS has a habit of pulling up in front of my building, then they send a text stating that my package is “undeliverable.” The first time that happened I went outside to the truck. The driver was sitting there, looked at me and drove away. They then sent a message stating that I could “pick up the package at their building.”  I called them and basically was refused delivery. So I told them to send the item back and was told that “there would be a fee of around $55 which is ridiculous for a $4 item! I informed them that I was “not going to go to their building. If I had transportation I would just go to drugstore to buy it.” It sat in their building for about six weeks until they decided to return it. This has happened a few times since and now I’m getting a run around regarding a package they have previously refused to deliver. Last night at eleven pm I actually received a text stating that they just tried to deliver my package (which has sat in their building for months) and nobody would receive it (at 11pm!) even though I am sitting here and know better. What is wrong with them? They have my number obviously and will text to tell me that they are “unable to deliver” but NEVER do they text to actually deliver! Why can’t they text or call and ask if I home and can I take my package? They are certainly a shady business! How do they make money with this attitude? I live in a nice respectable neighborhood and I have seen this attitude previously before I moved here when I lived in a house (also in a nice neighborhood). How do they make money when they refuse to deliver my packages? It is quite obvious that their goal IS NOT to actually deliver packages!",2023-12-28 17:46:31,US

For my current delivery, theres TWO non existent attempts. First they can’t find the address (then I called them and attached new address with my phone number, and a gate code in case you want to drive inside). Then 2 attempts isn’t happening because they need more “security access” and the gate clearly can be accessed on the pedestrian side (as DPD, Amazon, RoyalMail) deliveries did.

The guys told me there was a pickup van and they provide the driver with all the parcels they had stored, which happens every one or two days, then I should better ask UPS for the missing box, which I did and opened a support ticket on the UPS website and the answer I got was ""sorry, the barcode of your parcel was never scanned and it has been already two weeks since the drop-off -- we cannot do nothing"".In other words, you print the barcode, get it delivered on the drop-off point, do the tracking with the code you receive on your phone, but then it is your responsibility to safeguard and followup the delivery.

The package arrives in France, it is positively zoomed down to our area, I was getting to be very impressed at this point, I'm even more excited the next day when UPS inform me the package is 'out for delivery' now then, I have to admit I did feel a little twinge of hope, could this be true? Delivery between 11am and 1330! I even gave the driver a little leeway, knowing that there were going to be a lot of deliveries I don't mind if he's going to be a little later, I am so excited, I could be drinking my coffee with my normal creamer in it....Fantastic, yet, in the recesses of my brain there is a little warning bell, there is also the 'voice of reason' (my husband) downstairs reminding me of past ups experience, but no, did I listen, no! I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt, even UPS can't get it wrong every time....can they! Anyway, back to tracking, I can even watch the little van on the map, every village and all the time getting nearer, Oh the excitement, one village away and I know how long that takes to get here, 10 minutes tops, so I patiently watch the little van, wait for him to drive into my garden, ooh, in 15 minutes I'll be drinking the nectar of the gods, Ooh he's getting closer,oh he's ..................parked in the picnic area 3 minutes from us, he's driven past the house, poor lad , he'll come by in a second, then I get the next message from UPS (yes, I know, I can hear you all screaming at how stupidly trusting I am) Delivery attempted................I don't think so mate, not on you Nelly, the little toad did't even stop for breath let alone the 1 meter from the road into our garden, the little toad drove straight past without even slowing down.This was going to be the highlight of my Christmas, it seriously was.So, I called the designated number to tell them to call him, I'll meet him outside, he has to drive past my house again to escape to whatever pit he came from, in the end the driver was contacted, the package is to be taken to one of their designated places, I can collect it from there.We practically run to the car, two confused dogs in tow and drive like madmen down the mountain to the drop off point only to find out it is closed.I am back home now, wet very sad and madder than hell itself. I called the next morning to make sure I can collect, no, sorry it hasn't been delivered yet, so the toad didn't bother ( quelle surprise) it's Christmas eve now, I have to call again today, I pray that they have had the decency to deliver but my heart is telling my head to be calm, I won't get my perfect coffee until after Christmas now.Christmas coffee will be ruined all because of a lazy f@@@@@ that wanted to get back to his depot.Would I recommend UPS?Not a chance, I would advise the very nice customer service people to look elsewhere for work, their blood pressure must be through the roof.Merry B@@@@y Christmas UPS and I hope all your batteries are flat.",2023-12-24 08:40:34,FR

1,You deserve a 0 and close your doors. Horrible!,"I would never give you a 1. More like a 0. How can a delivery service be so horrible with people's packages? First of all the package was with 4 others. Your driver stops to drop off 5 but because no one answered the door you couldn't leave the 5th? Your driver jumped out of his truck, dropped 4 packages,  knocks, runs back to his truck, before the door could be answered. My husband was 10 ft from the door. Driver was gone! You would have thought the package needed to be signed for. From there we wait until 6:30 to make sure he doesn't come back. Nope! He sure doesn't! I call the 1-800# to go through a horrible robot that really pisses you off. Got a call back from an operator. Tells me pretty much that your drivers suck. I Couldn't agree more!!! From there she has my information sent to the dispatcher for this delivery area. Call is supposed to come by the next morning. Reason for the call? Because operator #1 informs me my package will be delivered to a remote location.  ? Remote location my ass. My package stated my location. Not a location I needed to go find, because your driver is a dumbass. Ok so I get the call from the dispatcher.  Nice lady! She informs me my package indeed will be delivered to my intended delivery location and not the remote location.  Why? Because,  once again I am told their drivers suck . Yep, i agree once again. She also informs me  to put a note on the door, saying leave package here and sign it. Driver will have to leave package. We'll we did so on 2 doors. However, for 17 hours myself, my husband or my daughter sat right in front of the door watching for the delivery,  because no one was going to miss this driver this time. Come 8 pm when it said it would be delivered.  Guess what, nope. The delivery information now turns to running late but still on its way. Fast forward to 8 am this morning. 12 hrs after it was to be delivered.  I call yet again, to your 1-800 annoying robot. To get a callback. This conversation did not go well. Why because I now find out my package was at the remote location that I was assured it would not go to. Why? Who the hell knows. Maybe your dispatchers and operator's are liars, but unlikely.  More likely because their piece of crap bosses probably make them say ctap and pray for the best. Wait for the best part of this story. I then call the remote location and ask if they have my package.  Yes, yes they do. So now we get to take a trip and locate the remote location.  Here's the best part of the story.  I don't have to sign for any package and they now can't find my package either. Great job UPS it was my 5 yr old grandsons Christmas present. Never had an issue with FEDEX.  I will also guarantee you I will place another complaint with Amazon, as I demand my money back due to your lack of ability to delivery my packages.",2023-12-24 00:38:16,US

I called this morning and after waiting for another hour to speak with someone I was told that it would take 48 hours for the correction to be processed.  Alternatively, I could drive to Tempe, AZ, and pick it up myself!!!   In the end, I asked where the person I was speaking to was located ..... he answered the Philippines.

1,Warning to Shippers,"Warning to Shippers,  UPS is running a calculated Scam operation. You ship thru ship station. Owned by Stamps.com  You get your cost for the shipping through ship stations feed with the carriers. You pay and ship. UPS then at a later date , unknowingly to you, makes an adjustment (additional charge ) on to many shipments thru stamps.com and take the money right out of your bank account and there details of the adjustment are either completely untrue or phony or make no sense.  Now when you have many of these and you try to make a claim, they want you to fill out pages and pages of the claim form. Maybe 33 questions they ask , when all they need is the tracking number of the disputed shipment. That tracking number has every single drop of information they could ask for. Instead they purposely make it so tedious to make a claim for the amounts the extra amounts they take from you and it takes so long to fill out each claim that it cost you more to make the claims than to let them steal from you. They know this and they count on it.  There has been many class action suites against them for this with millions and millions of dollars awarded to the plaintiffs. But not enough to get them to stop this fraudulent practice because I believe that even with the lawsuits they make more doing  it even with paying millions.  the date of this started a long time ago after I switched my carrier from USPS to UPS.  USPS rarely charged a Adjustment Fee and when they did , they were normally correct but not UPS.    Now if you fraudulently and on purpose took money out of someones bank account what do you think would happen to you.",2023-12-23 06:13:55,US

No one had any idea where it actually was or what the problem was. Finally got an email to say it was 'on the way'. Using Google maps I could see the package had move 10km (a 27min journey) in 16 days. It was then apparently left in Manises airport for 4 days. I called yet again and made a complaint about the poor service and lack of communication. The very next morning had an email to say it was now in the UK. I think they just put random information into the 'tracking system' to throw customers off, it's completely down to chance if and when you get your delivery. If I was a seller, I would never use UPS to send anything!Package arrived the next morning after I had lodged an official complaint about the shocking lack of communication from UPS. According to their 'system' it travelled from Spain to London to Bristol to my home between 11pm last night and 8am this morning. That's pretty impressive if it was actually true!

I called back to the on line home depot operator and was told that if I am unable to repackage the 53 lbs. appliance by myself, all that is needed is the original packaging and my driving the appliance to the local ups store.

1,Zero stars if possible - very dissatisfied customer,"I am not one to complain and give a bad review but I want to share my story to the public so this does not happen to them.  I bought a pair of Uttermost lamps from 1stoplighting (original order # 10655672) on December 15, 2022.  The box was damaged but the lamps were still intact.  The lamps were not a good fit for our bedroom so we decided to return them.   The return request stated “THE ITEM MUST BE IN THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING AND IN RE-SELLABLE CONDITION.  ANY DAMAGE INCURRED DURING SHIPPING IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SENDER.  WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU PURCHASE INSURANCE SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE ITEM(S)”.  We did tape any holes and cuts on the exterior of the box.  The lamps were placed back in the Styrofoam packing within the box.   I was instructed to return the items directly to Uttermost Returns.  I dropped off the package at a UPS drop off on 12/19/22.  I purchased insurance based on the cost of the lamps which was about $300.  I checked online tracking to ensure Uttermost Returns/1stoplighting received the package and we received a refund.  On the site, it later stated refund could not be processed due to lamp damage.  There was no customer service number to contact Uttermost Returns Center so I contacted customer service at 1stoplighting.  The service representative did provide me with 2 pictures I’m assuming was from Uttermost Returns.  The pictures were not clear and hard to tell what was actually damaged.  The representative notified me that I needed to contact UPS.  I first contacted UPS in January 2023 and was provided a claim number by the representative after giving him all the information to contact 1stoplighting to review the damaged product.  I was told that I would be contacted once they “investigated the problem”.  I never heard back from UPS.  I contacted them again on 3/14/23.  I was told that the claim had been closed because they were unable to view the damaged product.  I had to explain again that I was the sender returning a product to Uttermost Returns and the lamps were bought through 1stoplighting.   The claim had not been resolved.   I was told they would look into this.  Still no feedback from UPS regarding the claim.  I contacted UPS again on 4/20/23. I repeated myself for the third time after the representative told me the claim had again been closed because they were unable to view the damaged product.  So there was no confusion, I sent a copy of the return information, shipping label from UPS drop off, and the pictures that were provided to me by 1stoplighting.  After several months of giving UPS an opportunity to resolve this issue, I contacted them again on 11/6/23.  I was informed by the UPS representative that the claim had been resolved.  I told him it had not and explained for the fourth time what happened.  He instructed me to contact the receiver.  I told him that I was told by them to go through UPS.  EACH COMPANY BLAMING THE OTHER.  I also stated that I was instructed by 1stoplighting to pack the lamps in the original box.  He then stated that my claim had been denied due to improper packaging.  After stating that I would write a bad review on the UPS website, I was told “to hold off, that he would file a dispute”.  Needless to say, after 1 year, nothing has been resolved and I’m very frustrated.  I’m not only out the $300 on the Uttermost (which by the way is a great company and going directly through a local designer store for purchase is never an issue) lamps purchased through 1stoplighting but also the insurance money purchased through UPS.  So, what is the point on buying package insurance if no one is going to honor it.  So buyer beware.

1,Don't even know where to start,"Don't even know where to start, so I'll just give a short summary. Shipped a brand-new linear amplifier to a friend in Arizonia from here in So Cal. The amplifier was a day late and essentially destroyed from very negligent handling. Filed a claim and this is where the fun began. They picked up the amp from my friend's house and 44 days later received a check for about 1/2 its value. They first rejected my claim saying it was not packed correctly. Apparently, they do this to everyone that files a claim. The absurdity of that alone was hysterical as the package was shipped in its original bullet proof carton and double boxed with additional filling and cardboard protection. The damage was clearly from dropping based on the damage to the chassis of the Amp and crush type damage to the box, filler and supports. Even a UPS rep clearly saw this and the pictures didn't lie. In any event and after clearing up that loop, I have about 22 hours of phone time, 54 emails, and 12 letters involved with trying to get my money that was finally partially paid 44 days after filing the claim. The still owe me over $500. The draconian robot phone system, virtual customer service and incompetent human customer service is an absolute nightmare and on a good day completely worthless. I intend to sue UPS and I will seek damages in the amount of my efforts and all I can get based on what the court will afford me. UPS was once a good reliable company with good customer service.

I called UPS and ended up talking to someone in the Philippines who confirmed with me that the address was in fact correct. I was assured by the person in the Philippines that someone would call me within an hour to arrange delivery, but nobody called. I have received numerous deliveries from other logistics companies over the last few weeks, and even received another delivery from Amazon Logistics on the same day a few hours earlier. A few days prior I received a delivery from DPD. A few weeks ago I received two deliveries from DHL. On all occasions the driver either delivered the parcel to my door, or called me to get help with the delivery if they were having trouble accessing the apartment block I live in.  UPS have failed to deliver to me more times than they have succeeded - on one occasion they even lost a laptop from Lenovo. I have dealt with FedEx, DPD, DHL, Amazon, and even AnPost without issue.

(The Dutch sender had immediately acknowledged email receipt of this on November 23rd, advising me on the 24th the item was packed and ready).So, ready to take my money and with a delivery label issued, UPS appear to have done nothing for 8 days and are yet to reply to my messages to both UPS UK and UPS Benelux.What rubbish service. I will not, if possible, ever be using them again.Since this review, my urgent parcel was eventually delivered in early February 2024 after 7 weeks and countless emails to and from both UPS and the sender.

1,Non-Existent Customer Service on Next Day Air,"There’s no way that their actual on-time percentage is 98% because I’m just one person with an easy delivery area and I’ve only gotten my Next Day Air packages the next day maybe 65% of the time. I’ve spent at least $700 on overnight service in the past 3 years JUST on packages that did not come overnight. Of course I wasn’t refunded because they don’t guarantee or refund Next Day Air anymore. If I ran my business the way UPS handles theirs I’d be in prison for accepting and keeping customers money and giving them nothing in return. Don’t offer a service for a price and then refuse to guarantee that service. As I type this the Fed Ex truck just pulled up to my neighbors. I’ve only ever had good service with them, so I’m trying to figure out why UPS seems to be circling the drain as far as customer service goes but Fed Ex has stayed consistently well with their deliveries and how they treat their customers. UPS needs an overhaul. If I had the choice to use Fed Ex at the places I order from I would but they only use UPS. Frustrated doesn’t even begin to describe how I felt on the phone when the agent told me it would be here today and when I asked how it could be here today when it’s still several hours away at the origin scan I was told I would just have to wait and see if it came today and if it didn’t then I could call them back. For what? You’re not going to give me a refund so what’s the point of going through all the steps to “ask” UPS to call me just to be told to contact the seller who will tell me they can’t do anything about it because it’s in UPS court since they picked it up and just sat on it at the origin facility. I even offered to drive 5 hours to that facility to get it and then I was told “You can’t do that because we don’t know where your package is exactly”. So, if you have the choice take your business elsewhere. Also, UPS start telling the truth about how horrible your service has become in the past couple years. This had nothing to do with Covid in 2020, this is a problem in your company. Go back to guaranteeing your service or stop offering the service so more places will start giving me the option to use Fed Ex for my deliveries.",2023-11-30 18:34:10,US

Then you have contact customer support, go through the usual mind numbing auto-garbage, eventually speaking to human.The claim form takes 10 working days to process, during which time you are left in limbo, not know whether to reorder the item or not.The fundamental issues seem to be a lack of detailed tracking info as parcels enter and leave warehouses, and secondly a total lack of urgency when things go wrong.",2023-11-30 10:54:34,GB

Instead, they stayed on Golden Gate, never called, or made an attempt to deliver to me. Instead, they placed the sticker next to the sign that says “ deliveries ONLY on McAllister.” Now I have to go through the hassle of possibly paying 7$ for pickup or be annoyed by them “attempting” again tomorrow.

1,Reliably horrible customer service,"I placed what should have been a routine, quick, and easy phone call to support that ended up being over 40 minutes of being put on hold with incompetent outsourced support. I'm a shipper who had a customer change his delivery address after the package had already shipped so I went on UPS.com on 11/21 and paid to have the address changed, and over a week later the address hadn't updated to the correct address so I decided to call UPS support.I simply asked ""Steven"" agent ID 5231360 if the package would indeed be delivered to the updated address and he kept putting me on hold for extended periods of time without refreshing or updating me likely in hopes I would abandon the call and ultimately could not tell me if the address was updated successfully. It's unbelievable that in 2023 a corporation such as UPS still outsources their support to incompetent foreign countries call centers while a lot of others companies are bringing those jobs back to the states because customers despise speaking to people they can barely understand. The only reason I can see why they continue to outsource support is corporate greed, the executives obviously do not care that their company has over 30,000 1 star reviews on trustpilot so I'm probably just screaming into the void by writing this.",2023-11-30 02:17:02,US
1,I have had a few bad experiences with…,"I have had a few bad experiences with UPS but I felt that as much as I did not like the particular situation it was surely not common. I thought don't be a whiner. So, when I had an important package to be delivered this week I decided against my better judgement to use UPS. I usually check the reviews first but I thought that UPS was basically ok. Wrong!!! I wish that I had checked the reviews first. It would have let me know that I was not being a whiner and my suspicions were correct. So If you are someone you know is thinking about using UPS just don't. However, if you use UPS go to a UPS store and not a drop location. You have probably at least a fifty fifty chance of your package being delivered in a timely manner if at all.  No matter what address you write on your package it can be delivered to another address. They will take a proof of delivery photo clearly  showing the wrong house or apartment number but it is job well done as far as they are concerned. Also, you can forget about speaking to a human and you will get no useful information period. Now, you have no idea if or when your package will be received. It is a hurry up and wait process and you have to wait to start the claim process. Nevermind what was lost and if it can even be replaced. But mostly it is a vague distant detached mindset that says so your package went to the wrong address s--t happens, deal with it. It'll take a few weeks because we've moved on but we'll do what we can. They have a lot of customers and will continue to do so until enough people say I've had enough and I'm not going to take it anymore.",2023-11-30 00:55:17,US

I signed up for the stupid “my choice” program so that I could request notifications on my package and try to get home to sign for it. Of course I never received any notifications about it. I left work early with high hopes that I would be there when it was delivered. When I got home there was a note on my door that I missed my delivery. No email or texts or anything. I went online to try to get them to leave the package at a UPS store for me to pick up, and of course their website wasn’t working. I called in to try to speak with a customer service rep and get it sorted out but the robot answering machine wouldn’t let me talk to anyone.

When you try to explain something to reach a representative, it responds with ""I can help you"" but provides information you already know, then hangs up. For instance, I waited six days for a package that was supposed to be delivered on November 23rd. Throughout this time, I've been given the runaround. First, they told me the package was damaged, then claimed there wasn't enough cushioning inside. Later, they said the product had internal damage, suggesting improper packing or insufficient cushioning. If that's the case, why did they let the package get shipped all the way to the state for delivery, only to declare it as damaged? Moreover, they alleged there was enough cushioning to send it back to the sender.I called the customer service line multiple times, and they transferred me to the Damage Exception group. From there, I was transferred to the Pi department regarding the claim they initiated. After communicating with them, they acknowledged my concerns and said they would message the warehouse to complete the delivery to the correct address. They assured me that the warehouse would call to confirm if I still wanted the package. I was relieved that someone seemed to care. However, the next day, I didn't receive a call. When I called myself, they stated they would expedite the process, and I would receive a call within an hour to confirm. Despite my patience, no call came. The following day, they informed me that they couldn't do anything, and the package was back in Wisconsin instead of being delivered to the intended state.Don't expect any help from UPS until they straighten out their issues and improve customer support. Without a doubt, I can say they are the worst shipping company.",2023-11-28 18:44:39,US

Okay, maybe I can at least ask them to leave it in the one of the UPS office's? YES, you could do that before. Thanks to that I at least was able to come pick those packages myself, instead of getting the shipped back. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? They made that option paid! HAHAHA. YOU FoCK*NG SCUMBAGS. First, you UPS follows all the rules of how to NOT properly deliver a package, at the times when people are actually home. Like the majority of people works 9-5 Monday-Friday. How tf can you set a timeframe like that? BY 9PM! so it could be 8:00am, or it could be 5PM. WHAT ARE THEY ON? Like am I supposed to lose a day of work for a packge worth $50 and which requires adult signature? FU*K NO. OKAY JUST LET ME TAKE IT MYSELF. NO! PAY FOR IT. FoCK*NG SCAM PIECE OF SH**T.

Today is Monday, I'm working remotely (which is fine, but not the greatest thing to do at my job for dumb sh**t like that). Same thing: Delivery by 9PM. I'm pateintely waiting, printed a paper saying ""Please Knock Harder"" because they do not attempt to deliver. I feel like they just act like mythical creature NPCs who come to your door and stand right in front of it. If you somehow noticed them - good, you get a privelege to  get your fxck*ng package.

When I went into the Norwalk CT warehouse, they called the police on me to have me removed from the premises for trying to pick up my own item I paid money for. After all, they promised me a day before would be there. When the Norwalk CT police showed up, they broke my glasses and it cost me over $150 to replace them (I have proof). UPS ought to pay that cost since they lied and Sadley the package never got delivered because of their incompetence and I had to pay more from a different vender for the same item who does not use UPS. Unfortunately, a lot of merchants use UPS and I have to deal with this each time they send a package via UPS. It should never be like this. They should never call cops on customers for trying to pick up item they paid money for! They should never lie to customers. Furthermore, their phone service is only a machine that gives answers from the website so if a similar situation you will be forced to go to the warehouse for customer service which leads to them calling the cops on you because you are part black and trying to pick up item you paid money for.",2023-11-27 03:25:41,US

I have packages shipped routinely from china, like this package, for personal use, and never have to pay fees, or have service problems like I do with UPS. As well, generic chinese shipping that transfers to canada post has been just as quick, cheaper, with much less hassle.

I called UPS and they were unwilling to contact their driver to have them attempt delivery again. A few notes for UPS: Don't send an email saying you'll be here at a specific time if you have no processes in place to ensure that is accurate.

Honestly, I thought I was going to have a heart attack due to the unbelievable frustration I experienced in having to deal with them. It takes more than an hour just to get somebody on the phone and then their broken english personnel shuttle you from department to department and finally just hang up on you when you voice your feelings.

1,If I could give negative stars…,"If I could have given a negative star, I would have.  Horrible experience.  Delays and automation— no accountability!  The irony is, after delayed shipment— I am (as I type this) on hold, waiting to speak to a “supervisor” and I have been on hold for almost an hour.  I think this was a way to get rid of me and my disdain for their treatment of me and my shipment (if I ever get it).  The pony express would be more reliable than this.  Funny thing is, they think it will be over when I get my package— on the contrary— it is on!",2023-11-21 03:39:50,US

And then nothing was heard from them for over a week.UPS would deserve zero stars for this, unfortunately 1 star is the lowest allowed.The seller issued me a refund, or course.

You then call them and a certain Janika says that you apparently wrote the address wrong and that it's not their mistake lol... As if I don't know where I live!! They then blame it on the seller. So I call the seller and they have the address right their end so guess who messed it up?! UPS.... UTTERLY PAINFUL SERVICE.. that's what they should be called!

I got a call from a guy calling himself Jared and claiming to be management and by his attitude when talking to me I knew this was the boss.

Then at 6:04 PM I get a note stating that ""Delivery was attempted, but sender not available"". I navigated their annoying IVR to finally request a call back from a customer rep. They did and promised me that someone from the local office would revert in 60 mins. Never happened. When I called them up again the next day, they said they had no record of me having spoken to a rep. This time they mentioned that the complaint has actually been raised. I gave up and decided to pay the additional amount to re-route the delivery to a UPS store. The online system is so bad, that it will not let me do this as well. UPS is the most unethical organization out there and should not be allowed to handle something so critical as logistics.",2023-11-19 19:30:10,US

1,Epi-center of incompetence,"UPS is the epi-center of incompetence. Ordered 4 wheels for my car that were scheduled for delivery on Friday, 11/17. Tried to change the delivery location to a UPS store as I would not be home to receive the pkgs that day. UPS wanted to charge $10 per pkg for this option, $6 on their worthless MyChoice app. I was not going to pay this and pad their pockets. While I was @ work, my ring camera alerted me to someone at my front door which was the UPS delivery driver. Spoke to the driver thru the camera & gave him a verbal (& recorded) authorization that it was ok to leave the 4 pkgs inside my fence (out of sight) as I was not home to sign. He refused & said another attempt would be made on Monday, 11/20. I work Monday so back at square 1. Called UPS. After jumping thru hoops on their automated phone system, finally spoke with one of their ""programmed"" customer svc reps, requesting Saturday, 11/18,  delivery. She made a notation in their system but couldn't give assurance of Saturday delivery. Eventually, tracking WAS updated for Saturday delivery by 9PM. I stay home so as not to miss the delivery. UPS truck rolls up at 4:45PM. Great, right? (I still had time for the appointment to have the wheels installed today). No. The delivery driver only has 2 of my 4 wheels. This makes absolutely ZER0️⃣ sense to me. My day has been a total wash because of UPSs ineptitude. The wheels were scheduled to be installed today, 11/18, but now the facility is closed. Under no circumstances should you use this delivery svc. Use FedEx, DHL, USPS, a stork, anyone BUT UPS. They simply do not care if u get your pkgs on time & have no qualms about leaving you hanging ALL DAY. UPS = U B STRESSED",2023-11-19 03:06:13,US

3,My only disappointment,"My only disappointment (it was my fault!) was that if I waited for a few days, most probably I would have benefited for the Black Friday discounts. Moreover, when I added the item to may basket the price was less than 110 euro. Three days later when I decided to buy the product there was an increase in price of about 15 euro. Otherwise, customer support was fine. I still have not tried the wetsuit since the water here in Malta is still warm (23 deg C).",2023-11-18 22:21:29,MT

We always resend them to our customers and don't open claim disputes with UPS to save our time. We spent too much time getting compensation more than 2 years ago (in March 2021, claim Request #:16521) when they damaged over 5% of the packages in a short period (it was approved  USD3,501 of ~USD 5,000 requested compensation) we had, a ZOOM conference, and a lot of emails- with reminders to refund our money for losses- that's why I give it 4 stars with thanks for Thomas O'Donnell from UPS who supported that process.

Yesterday, your agent told us how to do a refund because of the delay and admitted it wasn't processed as an overnight package and didn't leave until Wednesday. Today your agent has tried every excuse and still doesn't know anything. She tried to say we didn't pay for overnight shipping but my receipt says one business day. Then she said we didn't pay at all. I paid $175.04 USD. Then it wasn't in USD so couldn't be processed, my receipt shows it was USD. Then it was because the shipper and receiver were the same, but they aren't. THEN the shipment didn't exist at all and tne information we were providing didn't match their records. An update would be really great but instead I've been on hold waiting for a supervisor for over an hour. I've attached the receipt of the service I didn't ask for or pay for.

The following day I again checked the status to read unable to deliver to your collection point. I again phoned to be assured that my parcel will definitely be at the collection point the following day (today). Today I received 3 emails to say my parcel was ready to collect, I went to collect it to be told it wasn’t there and that the courier had not been yet. Come back later. I phoned UPS again to be told “but it says delivered” no comprehension of what I was saying. I returned to the collection point, the courier has been but my parcel is not there. I phoned again to be told “but the status is that your parcel is there”. I asked to speak to a manager or someone who deals with their complaints. Got passed around different people who all say “the parcel says it is ready to collect”. I have been assured that the tracking team are going to call me back today but as this was all 6 hours ago and I still don’t have my parcel I am doubting that will happen.

1,I Trusted UPS…,"I entrusted UPS to successfully courier a golf club that I had sold. I paid them money to do so. When the club arrived ,the packaging had a huge dent in it as if a heavy box had been dropped on it, the club was snapped in two pieces. I filed a claim for a refund for the value of the club and a refund for the cost of having them ship it to the buyer.During my claim filing I have had a large number of issues with the process. The web portal to file a claim sends you round in circles, the customer service agents have no idea what they are doing and just try to pacify you rather than help you.Despite doing everything they asked, they did not refund the value of the item, they did not even refund the cost of the shipping. Can you imagine a company advertising to deliver your item and then not delivering on that promise. I have essentially paid them money for them to break the contents. And then offer a refund for less than half of the item’s value!Does anyone else think this isn’t right?",2023-11-15 01:07:37,US

I was so delighted to see the magic of Christmas in someone who I’m sure has been delivering packages all day I mean it was almost 5 in the evening, anyway I smiled from ear to ear and we came up with a plan to bring the boys in and when I gave him the thumbs up he would shuffle the gift which was quite a large package that could have easily used two men, but Greg did it with ease. He managed to get it in the garage! I had to take a moment to say thank you Greg you rock!",2023-11-14 23:51:59,US

1,Equipment damaged in transit,"On September 26th I ordered online, on the UPS website, a collection and shipping service for a computer and keyboard set, from my home address in Portugal to my workplace address in the United States, therefore, a shipment from me to myself.Upon collection, I made the payment due for the service purchased online (UPS Expedited), which indicated delivery to the destination within 3 days, therefore on September 29th.The following week, October 3rd I believe, seeing that the shipment was still “in warehouse” in Germany, I contacted UPS by phone. Eventually, someone concluded that a “commercial invoice” was missing… Please remember that it was a shipment from me to myself, and also note that at no point during the online process on UPS’s website is any accompanying documentation requested.Having sent the so-called “commercial invoice” – 3 times, to 3 different agents – the shipment was finally unblocked “for delivery”. This is now October 11th i.e., 1 more week has passed.The equipment was received on October 16th (an additional 5 days, for a service sold and billed as “3 days”), in terrible condition, despite the 6 (!) layers of packaging with which I protected it at origin:- the outer layer (plastic film applied at the airport, the one used to protect hold luggage) was significantly damaged (and someone applied packaging tape instead), suggesting rough handling;- the second layer (corrugated packaging-grade cardboard) was soaked, suggesting that the equipment was “stored” in direct contact with water;- the original computer case showed clear signs of compression, suggesting that it had had load on top of it and/or been subjected to rough handling;- one of the two styrofoam pieces that keep the computer in place in its original box was broken, suggesting rough handling and/or exposure to prolonged vibration;- all screws securing the motherboard to the chassis were loose, and two of them had fallen out, suggesting prolonged exposure vibration;- the graphics card (GPU) mounting tab was loose, also suggesting rough handling and/or prolonged exposure to vibration;- two of the contacts on the PCIe element of the graphics card were damaged (beyond repair), once again suggesting rough handling and/or prolonged exposure to vibration.All this, despite the labels applied to the 4 sides of the packaging with the usual and appropriate symbols: fragile, keep away from rain and moisture, this side up, do not stack, do not compress...I was then absent from work from the 17th to the 20th of October, and it was only on the 30th that I was finally able to take the computer for professional diagnosis, which I received on the 31st: “determined GPU to be faulty – GPU is missing two gold plates from PCIe connector on the GPU board itself (likely damaged during shipping)”.On the same day, I sent an email to UPS asking for instructions on how to initiate a complaint, and received the following response on November 2nd:“I regret to tell you that we are outside the established deadline to open a damage report.The period in this case is 14 days from the day of delivery.We deliver it to you on the16/10. It has passed the limit date to proceed with damage inspectionI'm sorry I can't open the damage report.”UPS is yet another autistic company, like many others, that failed miserably in communicating with the customer throughout the entire process:- it seems reasonable to assume that, if I hadn't asked, the shipment would still be “in warehouse” today, awaiting a “commercial invoice”;- while “rules are to be followed”, where does “the customer is always right” lie in this case?Clearly, UPS also failed resoundingly in providing the service it sold and charged for, both in terms of the contracted vs. actual delivery time and in relation to the way it (did not) look after the client's property.Should I need to make a similar shipment again, I will take care to remove the graphics card and package and send it separately. Lesson learned #1.Should I receive another shipment, will aim to inspect and open the packaging in the presence of the delivery agent and to test the equipment and, if necessary, initiate a complaint immediately, even if I don't have all the necessary information. Lesson learned #2.At the moment I am patiently waiting for the start of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions to replace the damaged graphics card. If I'm lucky, I'll recoup the cost of shipping with UPS from the discounted price of the new card... Forced upgrade!",2023-11-13 00:26:38,PT

1,Subject: Concerns Over Potential Fraud in UPS Tracking System  I am writing to express serious concerns about potential fraudulent practices within UPS's tracking and delivery system,"Subject: Concerns Over Fraud in UPS SystemI am writing to express serious concerns about potential fraudulent practices within UPS's tracking and delivery system. Recently, I encountered a situation where the tracking status of a parcel was grossly misleading, showing that the shipment was progressing while the package had not been picked up from its origin.This significant discrepancy raises questions about the integrity of your tracking system. It's misleading for customers who depend on accurate tracking for timely deliveries. Such incidents not only erode trust in UPS's services but also suggest possible fraudulent activities or gross mismanagement.Prompt investigation and resolution of these issues are imperative. Customers expect and deserve transparency and reliability from UPS, and maintaining these standards is essential for customer trust and satisfaction.Swain",2023-11-11 08:28:01,GB

Unfortunately, the next day the package was still delivered at the package station.This is extremely disappointing as I have severe mobility challenges and needed to seek assistance from somebody else just to pick up my package. This is very humiliating and fully unacceptable. I paid a premium for UPS expedited worldwide delivery directly to my home address. UPS is discriminating against disabled people with its blanket policy of using package stations instead of delivering directly to people's homes. All efforts regarding inclusivity and accessibility are undermined by these kind of cases.Legal action against UPS should be undertaken for their inconsiderate policies.",2023-11-11 03:21:24,SG

Picture taken from driver where my package was left, is not my home. My gate has a lock so no way did i receive the package where the picture was taken.

1,Just don't bother with UPS,Just don't bother with UPS. Why retailers and Ebay members still use them is beyond me. A Mattress was being delivered yesterday so I disposed of mine as I would after receiving Delivery confirmations with any other logistics company. They kept extending the Delivery Window until after 3pm when they said Delivery up until 2359...then the later in the evening the update was for delivery a day later and 3pm ....which was updated au 4pm that advised it would be before 2359.....I called and was told it would be here by 6pm ....I checked again now it's delayed a working day...so probably Monday. But who would know. They don't work weekends. Compared to DPD Evri and various other companies that have a much better tracking System UPS is stuck in the dark ages pre online logistics basics and just haven't kept up. Clearly relying on what has been for years in other areas a trusted brand. This is not aimed at their Customer Service people in far away lands who have no access to any more information than us as the recipients on the app. So no point calling them. They see what you see and can give no further help.

1,UPS sends personal information to wrong fax number,"I went to my local UPS store to have some tax documents faxed to the IRS. After I returned home I noticed the fax was sent to the wrong phone number. Which was very unsettling with all my personal information contained in these documents.  I returned to the UPS store to show the employee what had happened.  He acted like it was no big deal and would resend the fax.  When he handed me the new comfortmation sheet, I looked and he again sent it to the wrong phone number. After some time of of him acting very confused another employee , sent the fax a third time. This time the fax was sent to the correct phone number.  All the first employee could say was third times a charm. UPS opens themselves up to a liability if personal information is sent to the wrong place. I would've thought a large company like UPS would be hiring competent employees that know how to dial a correct phone number. Maybe some basic training is needed. Stay away from UPS even something as basic as sending a fax. Jim",2023-11-10 13:44:11,US

Unfortunately the person I’m having legal issues lives in my house. Ups driver shows up and tried to get me to sign for the documents. I told him that he needs to make a note that it is a RESTRICTED DELIVERY, and I need the recipient to sign for it. I am the sender. I was very clear and he didn’t like that I called him out, so the smug a$$hole made a note that the RECIPIENT refused the delivery and the letter was brought back to my local UPS store. He knew exactly what he was doing: The store won’t refund me and told me I had to pay another $20 to send it out again. And UPS customer service is only for the “drivers” they staff, apparently no connections between the stores and the customer service line. My call was “escalated” several times and I was promised a call within in an hour. NO CALL came through, UPS is a damn joke. I’ve gone to my local ups office for YEARS, I go out of my way bc there is now actually a fedex office closer to me.
