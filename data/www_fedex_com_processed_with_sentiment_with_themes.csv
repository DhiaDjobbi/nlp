I have paid for a next day delivery with FedEx to send a gift package to a close family friend.

As I found from the tracking information later, the parcel wasn't picked up the same day, as the collection had somehow already taken place (10am instead of 1pm). This meant the parcel delivery would have been delayed by a day, which I could honestly live with. That's the last I have heard of my parcel. A week later and many days past the ""estimated delivery date"" without any updates, I took the initiative to query the shipment and navigate FedEx's incredibly inefficient website to contact support. After getting ignored for days, I finally find out that my parcel was actually destroyed and FedEx won't be covering any fees or providing compensation, as they don't cover anything made of glass.

1,Ref_Failed Delivery/ Marcus Manager Lied Promised delivery nothing happened,Ref - 771407111074C177289521- I thought FedEx was reliable but when a Escalations manager tells you a lie the moral of the company has been diluted. I spoke with Marcus after him assuring me that he was going to personally handle and issue only to find out my package never made it to it's destination. My Aunt was being honored at an event she is 98 years of age. I designed some legacy hoodies for them to wear a total of 7 for the main ppl attending the event for Amtrek retirees and family. The event is later today. I paid basically 40.00 for the package two day express. and you failed. The package arrived in Ocala at 10:28 and no one can explain how I had to call at 6 pm only to find the package was delayed yet no one can tell me why.

1,Extreme dishonesty regarding an ordered item.,I used to think that FEDEX had a reasonably good delivery service. Not any more!! I ordered an electricscooter thru Walmart.com. The shipment was supposed to come via FEDEX. Supposedly the item was out for delivery on Friday 1/17/25. Supposedly they attempted delivery that day and I was not home.But there was no FEDEX sticker on my door verifyinga delivery attempt. Then supposedly a driver namedMelissa was going to deliver on Saturday 1/18/25.At one time I actually saw an internet entry saying theyhad delivered very late at the front door. I looked and did not see it. I looked at all the other apartments in my area to see if they delivered to the wrong apartment. I saw nothing. Because this shipment came from the greater Los Angeles area I would have believed them if they said the nearby wildfires had damaged some parcels. Another possibility is a dishonest employee with FEDEX who stole the parcel.Here is another act of extreme dishonesty: When I wentdirectly to the FEDEX website to file a complaint directly with FEDEX I found out they had scrubbed the tracking number of this ill-fated shipment so I couldn't file a complaint directly with FEDEX.UPDATE on 1/20/2025. I made a trip way off to San Angelo FEDEX at the airport located on the extreme outskirts of town. Only one problem got resolved. Their automated system now recognizes the tracking number which it didn't before. I was told that another FEDEX location way off on the opposite extreme outskirts of town was handling home deliveries.One thing we need in this country is a federal law to force businesses to stop cutting corners on customer service and to stop thinking that artificial intelligence can somehow remove the need for customer service employees.

1,Terrible service delivery + rude customer service = PREMIUM DISASTER!,"I wish a rating of no stars was possible so that I could give it to FedEx. After forcefully paying a premium for overnight delivery, it makes me livid to be treated as poorly as I have been by them.My package, coming from Washington to Atlanta and containing sensitive documents, keeps being serially delayed without explanation. All I see through tracking is that it is in Maryland one day or Tennessee the next. Then I get email updates only after the previous deadline, informing me that the package would be delivered the next day ""BEFORE 8 PM AND REQUIRES A SIGNATURE."" They conveniently do not provide a customer service email address on their site. You have to call or use the chat service, which wastes many minutes with AI agents that aren't even helpful.The straw that broke the camel's back was receiving a voicemail from one of the male service personnel stating that the nature of my delivery address means I have a 48-hour window to pick up the package myself at their service station, which is so far away, in the middle of the week, or they will return the package to the shipper! This same guy, who didn't mention his name, was also extremely rude on the phone with my friend, who shares the same address, and scheduled her package to be returned to the shipper immediately after the unpleasant call WITHOUT her authorization. It's truly ludicrous.For a global courier service of its stature, my utter disappointment with FedEx's incompetence and lack of customer support doesn't even begin to describe my irritation.

After inspection the buyer sent pictures showing the damage taken from delivery.  There is a metel door that screws go into to mount door and they were broken clean off and the screws were bent.

I cringe every time I see that something is being sent through fedex. We had Factor for a while and they send boxes weekly. Not one ever was delivered to our house. We have had Chewy deliveries at three different neighbors and a few just thrown out in the open yard while raining without even a bag. I made a Chewy order a few days ago. Weather was moving in so it didn't surprise me that the Saturday delivery was delayed. No harm done. Sunday is Sunday. Didn't expect a Sunday delivery. Monday came around. I had scraped the driveway Saturday afternoon so with the sunshine could warm it all day Sunday. Before 7:00 this morning, my neighbor had left safely in a two wheel drive pickup truck. Soon after, my husband left for work in his car. Within a hour, a Hiller van was here for our seasonal maintenance. He made it up here just fine and even turned around and left safely all before the temps got above freezing. Hours and hours later... after sun and melting... and I mean close to 4:00 p.m., I got a notification that Fedex had delivered our package, but no one had been up to the house. I check into it further and see the delivery photo shows my unprotected, water absorbent, cardboard box full of my husband's hard earned money is sitting in a pool of snow melt by a very, public very busy highway during rush hour. Thankfully I was home so I was able to drive down in my truck to pick it up before it got totally ruined. I had to take my truck because I am not, at the moment, able to physically carry a fourty pound box up my hill. There was nothing NOTHING impassable or dangerous about my driveway. I took a photo when I got down there to show its condition. If a two wheel drive truck can make it up my driveway, Fedex can. If a car can make it up my driveway without the tiniest slip, Fedex can. Best shame ever on Fedex is that within half a hour of their ""delivery"", a USPS vehicle made it all the way up my driveway and left a package safely in the dry under my carport and I didn't find them in the ditch either.

I guarantee a minimum of 100 drivers drove past while their branded box truck sat in a completely clear driveway and the driver sat my box in the waterlogged grass then stepped back to take his photo to prove of his ineptitude.

1,My experience with FedEx,"My experience with FedEx: I am a member of a wine club. Incident on: I purchased three cases of wine that was to be delivered by FedEx. The driver came to my door and after I had signed for the wine he went to the truck, pull the cases out one by one, and placed them on the road pavement immediately behind the truck. 2: I purchased another case of wine from the same wine club and again they chose FedEx to do the delivery. The delivery was for the 19th of December and required an adult signature. I had an appointment so I asked my wife to keep a lookout for it. When I got home and asked her about the wine she said no one had come by. I looked at the tracking and it said that there was an attempt to deliver the wine but no one was here to sign for it and they would try again the next day. I stayed home the 20th to be available to provide a signature. No delivery. When I checked the tracking, it was not updated. I tried getting in touch with FedEx but no luck there either. I called the wine company and they agreed to send me another case as it appeared the first case was lost by FedEx. 3: the replacement case was in its way along with another case I had purchased. I received tracking that said it would be here today the 12of December. I had a family event to go to so I went to delivery manager o.

I will describe this as completely lazy, incompetent, and a I don't give a crap about the customer who paid for this delivery service. We have 10"" of snow on the ground in Indiana. However, I keep my driveway, sidewalks, and stoop clear of snow and easy to traverse. I completely understand not wanting to back the vehicle into the drive not knowing the terrain. But, for this particular driver, get off of your lazy rear end and walk my package to my stoop.

I tell her it was LTL, and she has to transfer me.

1,FedEx: The Unstoppable Champion of Delays and Disappointment,"Professional Review: FedEx Macon and Ellenwood Warehouses – A Nationwide Crisis of AccountabilityI am writing this review to express my profound disappointment with FedEx, specifically the Macon and Ellenwood warehouse locations. My experiences with these facilities, coupled with countless negative reviews spanning nearly a decade, reveal a troubling pattern of systemic issues that plague the company on a nationwide level.Packages are consistently delayed or remain inexplicably “stuck” at these facilities for days, sometimes weeks. Despite making numerous calls to the 1-800 number and speaking with supervisors, the response has been a frustrating cycle of empty promises and scripted reassurances. Support tickets are filed, and bold statements like “your package will be delivered by the end of the day” or “I will personally update you” are made, only for none of these commitments to be honored.The deeper I dig, the more I realize this isn’t an isolated issue. After reading hundreds of reviews across various websites, it’s clear that FedEx facilities nationwide are grappling with the same problems: extreme delays, lost packages, and a complete lack of accountability. The Ellenwood location, much like Macon, exemplifies these failures, leaving customers feeling powerless and frustrated.These inefficiencies have driven me to change my shopping habits. I avoid Walmart.com for time-sensitive purchases because their partnership with FedEx makes reliable delivery nearly impossible. Recently, I discovered that Wayfair.com also uses FedEx, which will now impact my decision to shop with them as well. In contrast, Amazon, which uses UPS and USPS, has consistently provided dependable service.The persistence of these problems highlights a larger issue with corporate accountability. If a company like FedEx cannot uphold the most basic standards of service, why should customers continue to support them? These recurring failures call for drastic action, whether through boycotts, consumer advocacy, or stronger industry regulations to ensure better service.FedEx must prioritize operational improvements, accountability, and customer satisfaction nationwide. Until then, it’s hard to trust this company with the delivery of anything important.Rating: 0/5The Macon and Ellenwood facilities exemplify why customers are losing faith in FedEx.

5,A more positive experience,"I recently ordered a watch from a Japanese seller on eBay. When they said that they were sending it with Fedex I had a look at Trustpilot and was quite disheartened by all the negative reviews and was expecting a frustrating time. However my experience was quite different, the package was tracked on every step of it's journey to the UK, and four days before the predicted delivery date I received an early text and email informing me of a delivery that morning. About 9.30 there was a loud knock on the door and a pleasant chap handed me my package in good condition, not battered or dented. So Fedex can do it right, it seems to me that they should just get rid of the drivers who are failing and employ some good ones.","Dec 31, 2024",GB,recently ordered watch japanese seller ebay said sending fedex look trustpilot quite disheartened negative review expecting frustrating time however experience quite different package tracked every step journey uk four day predicted delivery date received early text email informing delivery morning loud knock door pleasant chap handed package good condition battered dented fedex right seems get rid driver failing employ good one,NEGATIVE,"I recently ordered a watch from a Japanese seller on eBay.

At 4:39 p.m. a FedEx truck (caught on door cam) sailed by the house without stopping yet I got a message saying the driver “attempted delivery” but got no answer at the door. After some phone calls and further misinformation the recipient finally had to go pick up the package at a depot on Dec. 9th so it was never “delivered”.

For my latest shipment, I purposefully listed the weight a tad higher than it actually was. To my astonishment, FedEx managed to magically increase this weight even further, charging me an exorbitant amount—2x to 3x more than what should have been reasonable. This isn't just an error; it feels like a deliberate attempt to gouge customers. It's clear they're playing a game with weights to inflate their charges. People need to be incredibly careful and vigilant when using FedEx services. Don't trust their weight assessments; they seem to weigh things 'even higher' than what you've already padded. My advice?

1,FedEx delivery estimates and tracking…,"FedEx delivery estimates and tracking are useless. 'Out for delivery' means nothing, as my package was marked out for delivery two different days and didn’t arrive until 3 hrs after the indicated window on the 2nd day. No updates received at all! Tracking showed it was on a FedEx truck out for delivery, then back to the FedEx station the first day. Second day, on a FedEx truck out for delivery, then to a ’trusted 3rd party vendor’, but delivered 3 hrs after the indicated 4 hr window.  Calls to FedEx were not helpful, because they didn’t really know where the package was, and couldn’t tell me who the ‘3rd party was’ to follow up.

1,Bye Felicia!,"My issue is much like the other reviews written today. I am head of an animal rescue and do a lot of online convenience shopping, mostly from Chewy.com who's Dallas warehouse is 6 miles from our address. FedEx is their contracted shipper who's main hub is just out side of Dallas. Unfortunately this has not been an advantage. Over the years I've had my share of delivery issues with FedEx. Chewy has great customer service but unfortunately have no influence on how FedEx runs their service.  I ordered dog food and a bone from a different company out of state on Dec 6 and much like a previous reviewer, still haven't received it. The items were shipped separately. Since Dec 11 I have received daily emails saying items were out for delivery followed by nightly emails with updated estimated delivery dates....what? According to their system items were on the truck. On Dec 14 their system said one of the items (dog food) was returned to the facility for inspection so I figured it was damaged. What about the separate dog bone?  I received an email this morning that it was out for delivery then one this evening saying a new estimated delivery date of today! Their system said they tried to deliver it. Again...what? Their is a large sign on the front gate instructing that deliveries be left outside the gate. They also have terrible customer service who just give you the same info you can get yourself from their system.  I too have decided to stop ordering from companies that use FedEx as their shipper.

The problem is that NOBODY CARES and there is NOTHING YOU CAN DO to get them to change or improve their service. They just don't care about anything other than making money and checking off that they supposedly delivered a package when in reality, many of the drivers are just lazy and don't want to take the time to ensure your package gets to the right place.I ordered 3 packages from the same clothing company that uses FedEx as their shipper. Package #1 made it successfully to my front door/porch - score. Package #2, however, was dropped in the alley behind my house in the rocks and dirt - luckily it had not been stolen. Eventually I located it as I opened my garage to leave for work. Package #3 was marked as delivered but was nowhere on my property. I attempted to call FedEx customer service and all I got was the runaround with no way to reach an agent to tell them NO, THE PACKAGE IS NOT HERE! I DON'T CARE IF IT SAYS DELIVERED!! My daughter was nice enough to walk around the neighborhood to see if she could see packages on porches. She checked on one porch and discovered my packages were left at an entirely different house down the block! Can they read numbers? Do they know how to read a map? Or are they just incompetent or are they running a scam just to check the box saying they delivered to get their check and who gives a damn about your packages? FedEx - 1 out of 3 successful deliveries = 33%, which according to my math is an F.I have let the clothing company know that unfortunately, because they use FedEx as their shipper, I can no longer order from them because it is not worth the hassle to deal with lost items due to incompetent or thieving drivers. Oh, and by the way, this doesn't even include the package they lost 2 years ago that, to this day, has never been located and was worth over $115. At first, FedEx said my claim would not be honored and there was nothing they could do. After digging around in the maze that is the FedEx customer service department and threatening legal action, we eventually got someone to honor our claim and we received a check for the lost box. But again, the box has disappeared into the ether to this day.Do better, FedEx.

1,Today,"Today, as a result of the strike by Canadian postal workers, I visited my local Staples store to send out three small parcels by FedEx to family for Christmas. I live on Vancouver Island in suburban Victoria. The first destination was an Ontario address some 4300 km away according to Google maps. I was told the expected arrival date was December 18, only 6 days away and the least expensive cost (ground transportation) for a package about 12”x10”x6” and weighing less than 5 pounds would be just over $48. Good enough.The next package was about half the size and weight and bound for an address in Alberta some 1300 km away. Based on the same means of transport the cost was just over $47. Before I could properly express my disbelief, the clerk had managed to calculate a cost for my third item, a 6 by 9 inch bubble-wrap envelope going to a street address in the village of Pemberton, 294 km northeast of the store. “That will be just over $59,” she said. As I began to sputter, she simply rolled her eyes and with a pained expression said, “I’m sorry but all of the rates have been adjusted since the strike began.”This is just another loathsome an example of corporate greed. The fact that it’s not quite morally akin to hiking the price of bottled water 20 times over at the site of a wildfire is effectively offset by the fact that you’re handling Christmas presents.

1,A broken company,"Factual timeline of events: The package according to the tracking was supposed to be delivered on the 4th December by 6pm. On Monday 2nd December, FedEx sent me an email requesting more information for customs clearance. I replied the same day. I did not hear anything on Tuesday from Fedex, and on Wednesday 4th December, Fedex asked me to pay customs clearance. I paid within a few hours of receiving the email. There was no action on Thursday, and by Friday 6th December, I had already called FedEx customer service several times asking when the package would be released. I asked for the package to be held at the depot, so I could come collect it by 7pm. I went to the Fedex Depot at Prestonwickweg 1, Schipol at 6.30pm on Friday 6th December. The Head of Customs (a gentleman with white hair wearing a blue sweater, sorry I did not get his name), told me that FedEx had made an internal error with selecting the wrong clearance code. From this internal error made by FedEx, customs did not clear the package in time, and I could not pick it up on Friday 6th December. The Head of Customs took my number, and assured me that I would be called on Monday with an update, and that it would be delivered to my address to avoid me having. On Monday 9th December at around 11am, I received a call from the FedEx team advising me that it has cleared customs and it will be delivered today. I asked her specifically to ensure it would be delivered to my address, because previously I asked the delivery to be held. She ensured me it would be delivered to my address. It was not delivered on Monday or Tuesday. On Wednesday 11th, I called FedEx and asked why the package had not yet been delivered. The customer service agent told me that there was a ""hold at depot"" request and that's why it has not been delivered to my address. I asked her to change this so that it was delivered to my address, that same day, as it was already overdue. She said she made the change to the file to ensure the package was going to be delivered to my address. It was not delivered on Wednesday 11th December. On Thursday 12th December, I called the customer service in the morning to ask if my package was going to be delivered today to my address. She told me that the package was ""requested to be held at the depot"". I told her that this was wrong, and I requested to change it to be delivered at my address the day before. She told me there was no request, and that the package had not been scheduled for delivery. She said she lodged a request now to change this. About 20 minutes later (also on Thursday 12th December), I called back to ensure that the request had been worked on. The man on the phone told me that no request had been raised, and there was nothing pending to change. The package was still ""requested to be held at depot"". By this point, I asked for two things (1) proof that the request had been lodged, and (2) speaking to someone else who could make this happen today. He gave me (1), the case number (will send in a DM), which I am tracking closely for updates. And (2), he refused to hand me over to someone else to discuss the case. Overall complaint: Due to an internal customs error and continuous promises that cases or requests were raised even though they never were, FedEx Express is now 7 business days late to deliver an *express* package that was initially promised on the 4th December. Things go wrong with deliveries all the time, but how a company fixes it is what matters most to me. FedEx has continuously proved that they are incapable of fixing their errors. Whilst your customer service staff have been largely empathetic, their actions have been useless (or perhaps their actions were useful, but the systems or the chain of command is broken). Ultimately, I absorb the damage. My request: I am not looking for apologies, I am looking for action. My request is that the package is delivered to my address by Friday 13th December, 4pm.

1,Never Import Reps into India Using FedEX,"This review is exclusively for The Monopoly called FedEX India and more precisely about Importing from China to India.The service fee for customs handling of FedEx is1200rs inclusive of the GST.One nasty thing FedEX does is they will do their own due diligence on the item that is being imported and find more ways to make a case out of it such that they can earn through case handling fee. I believe their custom handling agents have some sort revenue targets they need to achieve on a monthly basis or else why would they do the following?I recently ordered an aftermarket BMW headlight from China, because I don't want to pay ""BMW money"" for the OEM headlight which is only as good as the Aftermarket part. In China, an aftermarket headlight for the BMW costs only twice as much as any standard headlight but that's acceptable cause the quality of these aftermarket BMW headlights are on par with the OEMs if not they are all the same.But FedEX marked the item as ""under valued"", right after the received the item in china, the tracking read ""declared value of the shipment does not justify actual value"" based off the invoice, even before presenting it to customs.I think they were like BM headlights - 220$ only? no way! (Cause the original BMW headlight was around $900, The Chinese aftermarket one was only $220) FedEX doesn't even realize it's not the original item and made my headlight to be seized for undervalue purposefully! Which I am pretty sure of cause, customs would never do such a things ( $220 for a headlight is still too much in India anyway!) but FedEX managed to make a case out it, with no customer support to explain the issues, they just send a bill bearing the penalty, duty, service change, convenience charge, GST IGST etc.. in the end, I decided to pay 40% of 900$ as if i am importing the original headlight! + plus the penalty + plus 3000 extra to FedEX for the case handling charges plus + the 1200 service charge for FedEX presenting the item to customs! and don't forget the 9000 Rs they asked for ""premium shipping"" in the first place.

Had a package from a big company ship me something that was broken into two shipments (honestly, if I knew FedEx was the delivery source I would have avoided ordering because there is ALWAYS an issue with delivery) - I saw that one was attempted delivery, but couldn't get into my apartment building so the delivery failed. I called FedEx to add notes to both of my packages (it wouldn't let me do it online - because that would be too easy??), and went on my way without issue. Receive a photo today of a package delivered and left OUTSIDE on a busy street (downtown street). Called to say what the heck only for them to tell me no notes were actually added to the call. Okay, first issue. Next, I explain I have another package coming and I'm worried about the same thing happening. They then proceed to tell me they saw the notes but refuse to leave the package inside of the lobby without a signature. (I said, you realize the irony in that, right? I'm asking you to leave my package somewhere safe and you are refusing but will leave it outside where it is absolutely not safe...). Instead, I asked for my package to be diverted to a local FedEx spot (another issue for the website: it can never find these spots around me!), and they said I can't until it's been marked as an attempted delivery (even though a delivery has been attempted, the driver isn't marking it as such, meaning I can't do anything about it). Absolutely no communication between representatives and drivers, and never able to talk to a manager (edit: last summer they lost a $200 package with sold out clothes that were unable to be replaced, and after 12 phone calls to FedEx I did get in touch with a manager - who had to call me back - to tell me that they had, in fact, lost my package. They said it was ""sitting in a warehouse somewhere but [you/I] can't just show up as it's in a pile and they don't know what pile because that is inside of a shipping container somewhere"". Absolutely ridiculous that FedEx can get away with things like this - are there no laws around this?

The reviews are awful and they are suppose to be the best?!!  How difficult can it be to be better than AWFUL?  They don't even deserve one star but it was my only option.  Very sad!!

Now I have to wait another two days for another delivery attempt or drive over an hour to pick up a package I paid express shipping for.The first missed delivery was partially my fault, but ignoring clear instructions after I called to resolve the issue? That’s unacceptable. If you're a company considering this service for your customers, DON’T. They don’t care about you or your problems. The worst experience I’ve ever had",Delivery Issues

I had to pay $50 and give my door code to strangers to bring them in. FEDEX said a manager would call me but never did. They just sent an email saying that the case is closed. Never use them again. Their incompetence cost me time and money.,Driver Problems

1,Worst customer service,"I have never experienced a worse customer service. If I could give negative 5 stars I would.I wrote on chat yesterday (Nov 25th) as I got no updates on a package that was scheduled to be delivered to my local pickup point. Here I was assured by the customer service agent Shah that it had actually been delivered. So I went to the pickup point and they could tell me that they had absolutely no package, and that their tracking showed exactly the same as mine. Waste of my time. So I went on the chat again (as it is impossible to talk to them on the phone unless you have an account). Here Dominik gave me the rudest and worst “service” I have ever experienced. He said that it had been delivered to FedEx Facility in Kastrup - over 30 km from where I live, by mistake. I needed that package yesterday, so I asked him to have it redelivered to my home adress same evening. He then redirected it to me. However he said that it wouldn’t come until today. Then I asked him to cancel the redirection and have it delivered at my pickup point. To which he once again said it was impossible (and not stating why btw), to which I asked for another pickup point where he then claimed that they don’t have pickup points in my vicinity (BULLSHIT).Then I woke up this morning to a shipping notification that it actually would be delivered to my pickup point. However, as I had experienced a lot of incompetence from FedEx already, I chose to doubt this as I suspected that they would mess up again. So I wrote on the Chat, this time with Rakim. He assured me that the shipping notification was right and would be delivered at my pickup point today. Hours went by with no updates on the tracking. So I opened the chat again and talked to Rakim - again - who now answered very rudely and annoyed that they were delivering to the pickup point.Not even 15 minutes later I get a notification that they had tried to deliver… TO MY HOME ADDRESS!!!

If I could give negative 5 stars I would.I wrote on chat yesterday (Nov 25th) as I got no updates on a package that was scheduled to be delivered to my local pickup point. Here I was assured by the customer service agent Shah that it had actually been delivered. So I went to the pickup point and they could tell me that they had absolutely no package, and that their tracking showed exactly the same as mine. Waste of my time. So I went on the chat again (as it is impossible to talk to them on the phone unless you have an account). Here Dominik gave me the rudest and worst “service” I have ever experienced. He said that it had been delivered to FedEx Facility in Kastrup - over 30 km from where I live, by mistake. I needed that package yesterday, so I asked him to have it redelivered to my home adress same evening. He then redirected it to me. However he said that it wouldn’t come until today. Then I asked him to cancel the redirection and have it delivered at my pickup point. To which he once again said it was impossible (and not stating why btw), to which I asked for another pickup point where he then claimed that they don’t have pickup points in my vicinity (BULLSHIT).Then I woke up this morning to a shipping notification that it actually would be delivered to my pickup point. However, as I had experienced a lot of incompetence from FedEx already, I chose to doubt this as I suspected that they would mess up again. So I wrote on the Chat, this time with Rakim. He assured me that the shipping notification was right and would be delivered at my pickup point today. Hours went by with no updates on the tracking. So I opened the chat again and talked to Rakim - again - who now answered very rudely and annoyed that they were delivering to the pickup point.Not even 15 minutes later I get a notification that they had tried to deliver… TO MY HOME ADDRESS!!!

If you call providing the automated system a tracking number, they’ll only give you certain options before disconnecting. If you don’t give them the tracking number wanting a customer service agent, the system will still disconnect. FedEx doesn’t frequently update their system either. Sometimes it’s 24 hours or longer where the agents don’t have a clue. Once I contacted customer support (before the new changes) 2-3 times speaking to agents. I had 2-3 agents tell me the same thing that they never received the package from shipper because it was in created a label status. They debated me nonstop. When the shipper contacted them, they updated the system showing they had it for almost 2 days.  Now it’s the same thing. Shipper emailed me they used FedEx with a tracking number. Now FedEx claims they don’t have it. I can’t get through their terrible automated system. Do Not Use FedEx",Delivery Issues

1,The most frustrating experience in the shipping world,"So.. the best thing about using FedEx is the ease of access to the app. The app is an AMAZING idea. But as I've noticed, the shipping times/estimates/way of operation for this company is absolute garbage. I literally bought items that came in two boxes.. and for some lousy reason, they get separated and can't be BOTH delivered the same day. I've had other carriers deliver items with two separate packaging and they've always shown up on the estimated date and time. This has me questioning their preparation and logistics procedures. I've had 10+ packages that I've tracked with the app and NONE of them have ever been on time. There's always some type of delay no matter how perfect the weather is between carrier locations. If I had the actual option to choose a different package carrier (that had an easy access application) then I would gladly suggest a different company. I don't know how the supervision or any type of higher-ups within this company work, but they should really get a move on buttoning up their guidelines. I think it's ridiculous when a company claims how great they are on their website and they can never match that energy.","Nov 14, 2024",US,best thing using fedex ease access app app amazing idea noticed shipping operation company absolute garbage literally bought item came two box lousy reason get separated ca delivered day carrier deliver item two separate packaging always shown estimated date time questioning preparation logistics procedure package tracked app none ever time always type delay matter perfect weather carrier location actual option choose different package carrier easy access application would gladly suggest different company know supervision type within company work really get move buttoning guideline think ridiculous company claim great website never match energy,POSITIVE,"So.. the best thing about using FedEx is the ease of access to the app. The app is an AMAZING idea.

1,FedEx demonstrates a lack of competence and appears to prioritize financial gain over service quality.,"I was expecting to receive my package today; however, it appears that there have been significant operational shortcomings with FedEx. The process of transferring packages from transport trucks to delivery vehicles is not being executed efficiently. It is concerning to observe that management may not be effectively addressing these issues, resulting in lower standards of service. It is my belief that a thorough investigation into FedEx's practices is warranted to understand the underlying causes of these persistent problems. Additionally, the possibility of a class-action lawsuit should be considered. Earlier today, I spoke with a customer service representative who assured me that my package would be on the delivery truck today, despite the fact that deliveries typically do not occur in the afternoon if the package has not already been loaded onto the truck. Upon calling back, a subsequent representative provided more accurate information, indicating that the delivery would not take place until Tuesday due to the federal holiday. This experience raises concerns regarding the level of training and competency among staff, as well as a lack of transparency in communications. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss these issues directly with senior management, including the CEO, to understand how such operational deficiencies can persist and to emphasize the importance of customer service in maintaining a reputable business.

1,DO NOT ORDER FROM COMPANIES USING FEDEX,"Fed ex laid off 1500+ express drivers and has outsourced those deliveries to local ""Ground"" drivers.

I have had 4 packages returned to sender in the last 2 weeks because the driver refuses to drive to where I live. And on the tracking, they list ""recipient refused delivery!"" That is some class A BS right there! And speaking of outsourcing, they have outsourced their customer service to India where they pay reps a dollar a day to read from a script and regurgitate the information that's available with online tracking. When I finally asked for and spoke to a 'supervisor' he put me on hold, contacted the local carrier, updated the address to a town address to make delivery easier for the driver, and noted my account. Except, he didn't.  When my order was still not delivered to the new address, I 1. called the FedEx customer service in India again, only to find out that there was no update to the address nor any note on my account that I had called to request a new delivery address, and 2.

1,Never use FedEx,"Never use FedEx!  Appalling and deceitful service that fails to meet its advertised claims.  They should add “ly Bad” to the end of their advertised strapline “Promise: ‘I will make every FedEx experience outstanding”. Incredibly difficult to get hold of the representatives who can actually help customers.   Courier lied about trying to deliver.   Twice this month, we have had extremely important documents sent from the USA which needed to arrive ‘next day’  after being sent.   On both occasions, the documents sent were required to complete an important and very time sensitive transaction.     On both occasions we received notification from FedEx that delivery had been attempted but no recipient was present. This was a lie since the property is never left empty and the recipients were watching and listening out for the courier.  On the second occasion - today - ,the recipient posted notes on every single door explaining that the recipient was present and if no one answered the door (highly unlikely) to please call various numbers. At no point were FedEx able to provide evidence that courier had actually been present.  Subsequently,  after lying about attempted deliveries, FedEx then delayed delivery until the following day which would’ve meant that the documents would not have been available for the scheduled meeting with lawyers. On the last occasion, the only way that we could get hold of the documents in time for the meeting the following day,  was to send one of the recipients, an 89 year-old man,  on a 1 1/2 hour round trip journey to the depot.   This  particular delivery (sent fromNew York on a Friday) had been scheduled for delivery on Monday between 8.20am and 12.20am and the document was recorded as being returned to the depot (40 minutes away) at 11 am.   However, we didn’t get notified of this and nor was it on the tracking system until I spoke to a call handler at 15.00 that same day.  It was very difficult to get hold of anyone in person.   When we did,  there was complete refusal to deliver the documents on the scheduled day.   There was also confusion about how late the depot was open .   To add insult to injury , just after this 89 year old man had completed the 1 hour 20 minute round trip to the depot,  I finally received notification that the ‘parcel had been delivered’.

1,FedEx provided The Worst customer…,"FedEx provided The Worst customer service with the exception of one individual.  FedEx ""Customer Service"" via 1 (800) 463-3339 is absolutely terrible and not at all helpful. The agent just kept repeating an apology and giving reasons why he could not do anything about an 80 lb. package being left at the bottom of the stairs where it could have gotten rained on, instead of at my door.  I am 74 years old and physically unable to take anything that heavy up the stairs. Next, when I spoke to the man in FedEx ""Escalations"" he did the same thing. Just kept repeating ""I'm sorry etc."" and saying they cannot contact the truck driver!  Like it isn't a FedEx issue at all. Ridiculous. He refused to let me speak to anyone else when I requested it. So, I drove across town to the FedEx Express office and actually got real help from M. She was helpful, courteous, understanding and kind. She called Topeka FedEx and asked them to send out someone to get the package to my door. There was no definite answer that that would be done since the supervisor was in a meeting.  So I waited. When I placed my order for the item in the package I was not given the option to write instructions for delivery. Another instance of poor customer service. When I called the vendor the agent told me, ""I'm going to be honest. This happens all the time with FedEx.""A few hours later, God blessed me with a young neighbor who tapped on my door and offered to bring the package up the stairs for me.  Awesome, thoughtful and kind of him!But sadly, my FedEx nightmare was not over because I called the Topeka Ground office to tell them they did not need to come because a kind neighbor had brought up the package. Unfortunately, I spoke to L. who had a great interest in quoting FedEx policy to me about a few things including re: female delivery staff and heavy packages. If the delivery person thinks it's too heavy they can skip taking it to the customer's door.  If FedEx does not want female employees to hurt themselves lifting packages that are too heavy then why put those packages on her truck?  And what is the customer supposed to do? And why would someone in ""customer service"" lecture me about FedEx policy instead of simply thanking me for calling to save a FedEx employee the extra trip?  I could have chosen to treat FedEx staff they way I'd been treated throughout the day (with the exception of M.) and just let someone make a senseless trip to my address. But M. had left me with a good feeling so I called.  And then L. ruined my improved impression by her FedEx-righteous speech and a very clear desire to ""set me straight."" Garbage.

1,FedUp,"*click* “Your order has been submitted. Thank you. Check here for tracking details.” *click*………oh no…no..no God no!….NOOOO! The package is being delivered by FedEx.This is my average response when I order something online and find out that FedEx will be logistically responsible for handling my package. I’d rather receive a prompt saying that my package will be hand delivered by a hitchhiker from California. I expect FedEx to deliver packages flawlessly to my residence like I expect to order a McFlurry at McDonald’s and they respond with “OK”. It’s just not gonna happen. We all know that McDonald’s ice cream machine is “broken” just like we all know FedEx in some shape or form will inevitably disappoint you. I want to believe that they’ll get better. That they’ll read these horrible reviews and say “ hey guys, did y’all know that we REALLY suck? We should try to improve literally anything.” But they don’t. I remember my parents complaining about FedEx when I was just a young lad.I write this review as a culmination of a generational distaste of the shipping and receiving giant that is FedEx. Today I received that package that I ordered this time last month. Like I said I don’t expect exceptional service from this company, but after today I just felt inclined to leave a review. I received a text from FedEx yesterday saying to expect my package to arrive today. I was excited to see that it would finally arrive. I clicked on the link for tracking and I saw options saying if I wouldn’t be home I could schedule it to be delivered to the shipping center and pick it up. My take from that was that maybe someone would need to be home, maybe they would need a signature? I told my wife to expect the package to arrive today. This afternoon I received a picture from my wife of a cardboard box sitting maybe a foot away from the street in my front yard. “Noo haha that can’t be how they delivered it. Maybe they delivered it to a neighbor accidentally and the neighbor put it there, I don’t know.”I clicked the link on my text that said that my package had been delivered. That link brought me directly to a picture taken by the FedEx driver of my delivered package.  Sure enough, it was a picture resembling the picture I had received from my wife a few minutes earlier. As I gazed upon the picture, I imagined what a miserable experience this poor package must have endured. About how it was probably recklessly thrown or kicked from truck to truck, or how it was probably lost a number of times through out its journey. And finally as it reached its destination, it was thrown on the ground in a fashion that I imagine would be similar to a NFL wide receiver celebrating a touchdown. A tear rolled down my face as I exited the browser.When I arrived home, I carefully opened the package to examine the shoes inside, half expecting them to have been previously worn. To my surprise they were unblemished and in good condition. It just blows my mind that FedEx finds it acceptable to just leave packages at the side of the road. Maybe this is their new process for trying to keep delivery times on track. Maybe the delivery driver was a retired paperboy who couldn’t give up old habits. Or maybe they are trying to be more hospitable to porch pirates, so they don’t even need to leave their vehicle to steal packages. Whatever it is, their quality of service never ceases to amaze me. I just wish FedEx would take a page out of the Port workers playbook and go on strike. Demand higher wages for their exceptional service and wait for their ridiculous demands to be met. Meanwhile, UPS could increase their fleet and do what they do best.FedEx, I don’t know your mission statement, your goals, or why you still exist as a company, but I do hope that one day you realize just how horrible you are at your job.P.S.

1,Horrible Service and Utter…,"Horrible Service and Utter Disappointment - Zero StarsIf you're considering sending your packages through FedEx, think twice. My experience with their service has been nothing short of frustrating and disappointing. FedEx has failed to deliver my package on multiple occasions, despite numerous assurances from their customer service that it would arrive on specific dates. Each time, I was left waiting, only to receive a notification that the delivery had been rescheduled—without any valid explanation.What makes matters worse is their customer service. When you call for assistance, you are met with representatives who might as well be automated responses. Their job seems to be simply relaying whatever information the system gives them, such as ""your shipment is scheduled to be delivered on this date"" or, more often, ""there is no update on your shipment, we will notify you by text or email."" Expressing your frustration, as I did, gets you nowhere. They repeat the same lines over and over, offering no real solutions or escalation to a manager or supervisor who could actually help.

1,Seeing their overall review ranking,"Seeing their overall review ranking, how long are these people even still operating in business? I had the worst shipping experience in my entire life with FedEx in like 2018 I had sold an apple phone and apple watch online and then right after I dropped off the items to be shipped. I realize that the guy had not actually sent payment but they were closed by then until I just told them go ahead and keep the shipping fee just don’t ship my items I’ll come tomorrow morning and get them. The clerk at the store assured me that was fine and then next day arrives and I go to get them and they tell me the stuff have been shipped. But it was still at the sorting facility in Sioux City so I reached out to them and whoever I talk to it was a female told me that they can’t just let me come get it and return it. They said the only thing they can do is let it run the course of the mail route like try to deliver it and if it don’t, then it will come back after it’s undeliverable or whatever and they end up delivering my stuff to the guy committing fraud. They even managed to collect his signature.Well, this time what’s going on? It’s pretty much the same except I’m kind of on the other end. I placed the order on Amazon. It was five items total four or five in the order. I honestly would not have even placed the order if I had seen FedEx anywhere.. so I’m an Amazon prime member and I’m supposed to get Fast two day shipping but it’s been six days total at least. Originally, when I reached out to FedEx on the phone, I found out that they have the most terrible horrible phone system ever made. You gotta say something else about 20 or 30 times before you get humans. And then when you finally get a rep on the phone, they act like they can’t do anything and they just try to get you off the phone. They won’t reach out to anything matter fact, they told me or they can’t reach the driver. But you know I’m  smart and they are an international logistics company with all kinds of money and resources and you want to expect me to believe that once you put a package on the truck and depart that it’s out of your hands. FedEx has no control over ? If you expect me to believe that you cannot reroute or intercept an item or even contact Driver? they says They attempted to deliver it three times but they’ve never been here once. As a matter of fact, when I track the package on their site location, clearly states Ames and it’s never went any further than that and that is not The shipping address for this item or this order I should say.  Seriously at this point like FedEx sucks so bad that I’ll get angry just even thinking about having to use them. And I’m canceling my Amazon prime membership immediately too because this is way way over past two days. Honestly, unless one of them finds a way to make it up to me.

1,The Impact of Job Denial Based on…,"The Impact of Job Denial Based on Background ChecksIn today’s competitive job market, individuals must navigate not only their skills and qualifications but also the implications of their pasts as judged by prospective employers. Recently, I faced the disappointment of being denied a job that I believed I was well-qualified for, despite having not been in any trouble for the past five years. This experience has highlighted the issues around background checks in hiring practices, particularly the challenges faced by individuals with past issues yet who are striving to lead responsible and productive lives.The incident that led to my denial of employment stemmed from a background check that revealed my prior issues, which, while serious at the time, I have worked hard to overcome. Recognizing the significance of my past, I have dedicated myself to personal growth and rehabilitation. I have attended numerous workshops, engaged in community service, and maintained stable employment since those troubled times. Therefore, the company's decision felt particularly unjust as I have proven my commitment to turning my life around.What makes the situation more disheartening is observing others, perhaps with similar or even worse backgrounds, being granted opportunities at that same organization. This inconsistency raises questions about the fairness of the hiring process. The criteria for employment should ideally focus on an applicant's current capabilities and potential, rather than being solely dependent on previous missteps. In my case, the lack of transparency regarding the selection process and the criteria used to evaluate candidates has left me feeling discouraged and marginalized.In a work environment where diverse backgrounds can contribute to a more innovative and dynamic culture, it is crucial for employers to recognize the potential of individuals seeking redemption. Recent studies have shown that companies that embrace candidates with diverse experiences, including those who have made mistakes in their past, often benefit from increased loyalty and a richer workplace culture. By refusing to engage with applicants who have shown they can learn and grow from their experiences, organizations are potentially missing out on valuable contributions.Moreover, the stigma associated with past mistakes perpetuates a cycle of disadvantage. When individuals who are eager to work and contribute to society are repeatedly denied opportunities, it can lead to feelings of hopelessness and the perpetuation of negative behaviors. Society as a whole benefits when individuals are given a chance to prove themselves rather than being judged solely by their pasts.In conclusion, my recent experience of being denied a job due to my background check serves as a reminder of the critical need for a more equitable and understanding hiring process.

Recently, I faced the disappointment of being denied a job that I believed I was well-qualified for, despite having not been in any trouble for the past five years. This experience has highlighted the issues around background checks in hiring practices, particularly the challenges faced by individuals with past issues yet who are striving to lead responsible and productive lives.The incident that led to my denial of employment stemmed from a background check that revealed my prior issues, which, while serious at the time, I have worked hard to overcome. Recognizing the significance of my past, I have dedicated myself to personal growth and rehabilitation. I have attended numerous workshops, engaged in community service, and maintained stable employment since those troubled times. Therefore, the company's decision felt particularly unjust as I have proven my commitment to turning my life around.What makes the situation more disheartening is observing others, perhaps with similar or even worse backgrounds, being granted opportunities at that same organization. This inconsistency raises questions about the fairness of the hiring process. The criteria for employment should ideally focus on an applicant's current capabilities and potential, rather than being solely dependent on previous missteps. In my case, the lack of transparency regarding the selection process and the criteria used to evaluate candidates has left me feeling discouraged and marginalized.In a work environment where diverse backgrounds can contribute to a more innovative and dynamic culture, it is crucial for employers to recognize the potential of individuals seeking redemption. Recent studies have shown that companies that embrace candidates with diverse experiences, including those who have made mistakes in their past, often benefit from increased loyalty and a richer workplace culture. By refusing to engage with applicants who have shown they can learn and grow from their experiences, organizations are potentially missing out on valuable contributions.Moreover, the stigma associated with past mistakes perpetuates a cycle of disadvantage. When individuals who are eager to work and contribute to society are repeatedly denied opportunities, it can lead to feelings of hopelessness and the perpetuation of negative behaviors.

1,They didn't try to deliver.,"The package was supposed to arrive on a Thursday. Then the day was suddenly changed to the Wednesday, the day before. I heard the truck pull up outside my place, and I waited (literally) right by the front door. The driver did not knock. Not only did they not knock, they were as quiet as a mouse putting a door tag on saying that the shipment was held for outstanding duties. I had already paid the duties that very same morning. No instructions were left on the door tag, the only thing written was the address of the distribution centre was scribbled out and a different one was penned in. The printed and scribbled out address was under 1km from my house, and the penned in one was 10km away. I called FedEx customer service to ask what this meant and what I was to do next, and they told me that if I wanted to I could pick up the package that same day after the time specified on my door tag. The delivery person had not specified a time on my door tag, they left that field blank. The CS rep said that delivery would be reattempted the next day.At this point, the tracking showed that the package was sitting at the distribution centre at 50 Barnes Road, Cambridge, Ontario, Canada. This status would not change.The following day, there was no delivery - not even a pretended attempt at a delivery like before, they just didn't even bother trying. I assumed that the CS rep had just been wrong, so I resigned myself to going in the next day to pick it up. The next day (now, the Friday), the status showed the package as still being at that distribution centre in Cambridge. So, I drove there and waited some time in line. When I was finally 'helped' by the gentleman behind the desk, he told me that the package wasn't there because it was on a truck to be delivered that day. Sure enough, when I got home there was an email I would have received approximately when I had first arrive at the FedEx centre, saying it was out for delivery - but they only told me that at 11.19am. This was unfortunate for me, as I was going to be working 8 hours that day and didn't want the package to be stolen.I needn't have worried about the package being stolen that night, however, as they 'reattempted' a delivery, but withheld the package AGAIN for 'outstanding duties and taxes' which, to be clear, I had paid the morning of the Wednesday, before the first delivery 'attempt' - over 48 hours ago by that point.

1,So...where to begin.,"So...where to begin.I ordered a very expensive camera lens, (around $2300 USD), and kept a very close eye on my tracking info once it got down to the wire. I had set it up to be shipped at a Walgreens near my place. I noticed that it said it had been delivered and decided to call Walgreens to confirm it was there before I drove there to claim it. I call, and to my horror they say it isn't there.""Huh, that's funny.."", I thought. Then I looked at the tracking closely and realized it didn't say WHERE it was delivered, just state and city, no address. That seemed very weird to me, so I called a close neighbor to go get the package off my porch, to which she reported promptly that the parcel was nowhere to be seen. To make matters much worse, I saw that it was signed over to someone who did NOT have my last name. It was at this point I knew someone had messed up royally.This is where I began a missing package claim. I got ahold of someone who did not speak very clear English at all, and I got mad at her, demanding to speak to her manager, who also didn't speak very well, though clearer than the other. I got to the point I was very frustrated, but she did tell me she'd get on the case. I didn't feel too confident at this point, but decided I needed to just wait it out and see what happens. Well, thankfully a man from the local station called some hours later and told me the exact location they sent it to. The location address was so dissimilar to mine that I still don't understand HOW they could have taken it there. I decided to go to that address and ask for my parcel back myself because I did not trust them at all. I get there, thinking it would be a residential address like mine, but it wasn't. It was an auto body shop, a CAR SHOP guys.

1,Customer support is useless and lies,Delivery date was changed to 30 days before the original delivery date. We called and asked for the original delivery date as we were not going to have residency of the delivery address. A confirmation was given by customer support and confirmed the change back to the original delivery date. Was notified it was out for delivery.

Now on my most recent order, they managed to deliver none of it and I am now told that it will not be delivered until Monday. (2 days from now). Their driver actually walked up to my door and left the door tag rather than just leave the packages that did not require his signature or a person to be present for delivery.  This will be raw meat rotting in their warehouse that I will be expected to dispose of in two days. I was assured on two separate calls today that it would be delivered by end of business and told to call back at 8 pm if not received. When calling back at 8:00, because of course it wasn’t delivered, I’m told no supervisors are available to speak to and that I have no choice but to wait until Monday to receive my rotted delivery. No company should work with FedEx for their deliveries. All they do is destroy product. FedEx is the worst.",Driver Problems

I scheduled it for pick up in 9/9/24 by 10:30am no later than 1pm. They NEVER showed up even though I called them FOUR times to ask why and each time they kept moving the pick up time.
