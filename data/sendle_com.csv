1,Driver didn't even bother,"Driver didn't even bother trying to deliver the parcel. I was home, we also have an entrance way and stairwell where it would have been safe to leave the parcel, as well as a mailbox out the front of the property. Clearly the driver just took it straight to a drop off point instead of trying to deliver it at all. Customer service was pretty useless too, just told me to leave delivery instructions to help the driver. From now on I'll have to add ""knock on the door"" as their staff seem incapable of doing the most basic tasks without explicit instructions","Jan 30, 2025",AU
2,Poor service,"Used Sendle for over 50 packages during the Canada Post strike.  Pick up did not work - they kept promising next day, but did not show.  Ended up driving to the drop off each time.Very long delivery time, and 3 packages totally lost.  Only ended up with a refund on one - the other canadian one finally got delivered after more than 6 weeks.  The US one -  they failed to take action as they said it was handed off to USPS.  Unable to claim so am hoping it turns up","Jan 31, 2025",CA
1,I took a big loss using Sendle,"Tried using Sendle during the Canada Post strike to send Christmas parcel (book) to friends and paints to customers. I run a small paint store.Five parcels made it over a period of a month. Given it was Christmas season and given Canada Post was on strike I wasn't too upset with one month delivery time as the volume they had to deal with was enormous.The other five parcels completely vanished. No live human to talk to and no one from Sendle is reaching out to us even though we reported the losses over two weeks ago.The Christmas book loss sucks but not too bad, $25 book that I can repurchase and resend with Canada Post. One of the paint order losses was over $300, not to mention a customer who will likely never use our store again.If Canada Post goes on strike again, I will just close down and go fishing before I trust Sendle with any of my parcels again.","Jan 28, 2025",CA
1,The worst shipping experience ever,"The worst shipping experience ever. The subcontror delivery driver didn't even attempt to make the drop off. He must have not seen my number,  showed down on the road without pulling into driveway, then honked(!) once, and sped off without giving me a chance to get to my door. I was baffled. He also marked it return to sender. Ridiculous. Customer service tried to try again, but I am positive the subcontractor never even came back. The store will be receiving my package again and will use a different shipping company.","Jan 18, 2025",CA
1,Never Sendle,"Never Sendle! Even if you're trying to save money. Customer service will take over 24hrs to respond and will not do anything to track your shipment. Sent 3 shipments, lost all of them. No compensation for recovery.","Jan 20, 2025",CA
1,Even if Sendle was free - don't do it,"Even if Sendle was free, it's not worth the stress of its terrible service. They also seem to seek out the worst Courier partners, wherever they operate in the world, just read the other reviews. Generally they seem to partner with Couriers who just never pick up parcels from hubs, lose or destroy the parcels they do pick up, or have sub-human social skills when interacting with any other humans along the way. Customer Service agents are also not armed with much information or recourse to help customers because Sendle clearly has very few remediation processes or options for Customers that they are willing to undertake, meaning Service Agents bear the brunt of Customer frustration from all over the world. Can't imagine how thin their service playbook would be.Some super weird questions/quotes from them in providing 'solutions' to complaints/queries include:[Destroyed parcel] ""Do you have a picture of what the parcel originally looked like before this happened?""[Courier yelled at receptionist] ""Sorry about that. Is there anything else I can help you with today?""[parcel not picked up from hub in over 4 weeks] ""Have you tried getting it back and using someone else?""Truly chaotic.They position themselves as providing a cost-effective alternative to well established postal and courier services...but instead just illustrate that a 5% saving for rock bottom reliability and service is just not worth the hours of you'll lose out of your life.","Jan 22, 2025",AU
2,The driver didn't deliver the package…,"The driver didn't deliver the package at my door; they left it downstair, right by an unlocked door, a place everybody has access to.","Jan 16, 2025",CA
1,Lost package a month ago,Lost package a month agoWon’t do a refundThis business is a total scam in Canada,"Jan 29, 2025",CA
1,Package Not Picked Up for Over a Month,I sent a parcel over a month ago and it has STILL NOT BEEN PICKED UP! I dropped it off at one of their drop off locations. It was also recommended that you drop it off rather than get them to pick it from you directly due to the high volume of packages in Canada. I have reached out to support many times and they refuse to tell me when it will be picked up. They also recommended I go and get the parcel and ship it with someone else. Your whole business is to ship things...and you can't even do that. The vagueness in the customer response replies is also so infuriating.,"Jan 16, 2025",CA
5,Sending 100+ Parcels a Day And No problems,"We are a very large ecommerce brand and switched to Sendle from CP during the postal strike. We ship over 100+ parcels per day with Sendle. The experience has been great. Sendle customer service is amazing, responds within minutes and is actually helpful. This is unheard of compared to Purolator or Canada Post customer service which takes days or weeks to get back to you. About 98% of deliveries are completed on time.","Dec 17, 2024",CA
1,They got my address horrifically wrong,"They got my address wrong, had a city that didn't even exist, even though sender gave them the correct address. Apparently they can't google even Google a postal code. Pathetic","Jan 15, 2025",CA
1,Avoid Sendle - not worth the hassle,"I launched an e-commerce business in Dec 2024 and used Sendle for some of my shipments. They lost 40 packages and it was overall a terrible experience. They contract with local delivery drivers on both ends of the delivery. There is a lot of opportunity for mistakes since it seems like the delivery people aren't invested at all in doing their job. Packages were picked up but never scanned properly so it looks like packages weren't picked up. Sendle will launch an investigation and then tell you they have no proof it was picked up and will not refund the shipping or allow you to file a product claim. For packages that get lost somewhere along the way, they will also try to investigate but make it difficult for you to file a claim. So I guess I'll just have to take the hit for a couple thousand dollars of shipping fees, lost product, and resending product so my customers actually get what they ordered. I'm very surprised that Sendle is still in business. Lesson learned, stick with the established carriers like UPS and FedEx with actual employees that care about doing a good job.","Jan 13, 2025",US
1,Terrible,Terrible! They pawned my package off on a third party to deliver…still no sign of my package and they are not taking responsibility.  They are basically blame shifting. Please avoid at all cost,"Jan 09, 2025",CA
1,the WORST courier ever,"the worst courier ever. the worst and most unethical peoeple ever!!! do not use their services. if you are a business and you send multiple packages, you will lose 2 out of every 12 packages. they will not cover the loss because they will eventually find the package after a month in a difference province. and then send that to the customer, when the customer has already taken a refund. i have lost 4 packages and shipping, and my account at amazon went to deactivation because of them. I HATE SENDLE .","Jan 02, 2025",CA
1,Courier doesn't show up for pick-up MULTIPLE times,"Had to reorganise pick-up THREE times due to the courier driver not showing up. Their pick-up window of 8am to 6pm is also ridiculous as some businesses operate between 9am to 5pm. Upon speaking to the second customer service agent they said someone would show up at 6pm that day that I scheduled the pick-up so I arranged for someone to stay late in the office and guess what? They didn't show up. What a waste of time and resources. Also, their 'Pick-up Guarantee' is an absolute joke: ""If for some reason we still do not attempt the pickup the business day after the scheduled day, we will refund the cost of the delivery. We will still attempt to pickup and deliver the parcel."" I received no apologies or refunds. Originally scheduled Dec 10 then 13 then FINALLY picked up on 16. I would avoid using Sendle if you can.","Jan 06, 2025",AU
5,i think service varies a lot depending on area,"It's my first time using sendle, and if things go this well everytime, i will absolutely switch to them as my primary shipping company!Booked a pickup yesterday evening for today, the driver has already picked up my parcel and he was an absolute joy to interact with. Rates are also more affordable than Canada Post, which is nice. I guess service depends on where you live, because Australia reviews seem to be incredibly bad; which had made me nervous to try them out at first. I'm glad i still did. If you reside in QC or Ontario, i think this company is absolutely worth trying out!","Dec 06, 2024",CA
5,Amazing Job!,"Since CP is on strike, I decided to use SENDLE for the first time and ship a parcel from London, Ontario to Quebec. The whole shipping process was so easy! I printed my label and used a drop off location they suggested which was super convenient and could track it the entire time! I dropped it off on a Saturday and it was picked up first thing Monday morning and arrived in Quebec 2 days later. Amazing Job! Will definitely use them again!","Dec 04, 2024",CA
1,During the Canada Post strike we used Sendle ...,"While it was helpful to have a delivery method during the postal problems, there are significant issues and flaws with the service that make it very not useable for retail and business purposes where transparent tracking and timely delivery are necessary. The Number 1 problem with Sendle and ICS Courier is, as stated above, the lack of transparent tracking. A parcel can have - and usually does have - multiple carriers when sending via ICS | Sendle, including an initial freight handler that deals with ALL parcels dispatched. A customer and seller will both receive a ""delivered"" notification when only the freight handler or one of multiple carriers involved receives the parcel yet, the item is not ""delivered"" to the customer and they are confused. You have to message into Sendle directly each time to get all the latest tracking numbers and then communicate these constantly to your buyer. The Number 2 problem relates to claims and insured coverage. When a parcel is lost in transit, Sendle does not easily refund you the shipping or insured value. In our case, they wanted an Affadavit of loss even though they had the buyer email, the buyer's confirmation of non-receipt of goods and the online invoice showing sale value. I will never use them again.","Jan 19, 2025",CA
1,Poor shipping company and fraudulent transactions.,"The package I was sending from Australia to China did not leave my country for 45 days and arrived to China three days after maximum date promised. Decided to charge me more before delivery to receiver, claiming parcel heavier than listed which is a lie. Cannot track your items properly and only communicate with online staff which takes hours to get any response. Do not use them, rippoff merchants.","Dec 14, 2024",BE
2,Like many people on here used Sendle…,"Like many people on here used Sendle for my business and while the CP strike is on.  I love their pricing!  Very affordable.  However, like someone else mentioned.  I sent an expensive order out to a customer.  It got lost in transit and was showing it hadn't been sent. I've contacted them three times.  Still has not been resolved.  The order was lost and no one has contacted me. My customer is angry, rightfully so.  Now I have to replace the order again for another $200 + shipping again!   Not happy. I wished someone would provide a contact number so this could be resolved. Or provide me with a resolution and compensation for them losing my package.","Dec 15, 2024",CA
1,Bunch of brain dead idiots who during…,Bunch of brain dead idiots who during the Canada post strike outsourced my packages to Canada post even tho it’s supposed to be through ICS courier as the label says and they won’t refund. Why give it to Canada post in the first place if it’s supposed to be ICS?,"Dec 16, 2024",CA
1,Don't trust them,They use couriers please to pick your item up but then they just sit on for 2 weeks (now 20 days and they tell me they will post it on the 22nd a full month after pickup) and then send it internationally. What a joke you're much better off if you can at all get to a post office or get somebody to take it to a post office or dhl it or something. And they don't care at all they just give you a bloated delivery time estimate range,"Dec 10, 2024",US
1,Wish I could give no stars,"Package sent from Dryden ON to Thunder Bay and then to Etobicoke, when it was supposed to go to Rainy River, (3.5 hours south of Dryden and 5.5 west of Thunder Bay). It apparently took 6 days to go to Thunder Bay ( via camel train?) from Dryden, then a day later it's in Etobicoke ( Toronto Area, 23 hours south east ), it has been sitting there since for 6 days. Did these idiots ever take a geography course? The AI bot is useless and of course no phone number. Beware Canpar uses these useless people.","Dec 24, 2024",CA
1,Lost my package and shipped it back to me,"They said they couldn't deliver the package as they didn't have enough information.  Tried to contact them to see what else they needed, no phone # available, just through the website, then finally contacted them through email.  They said they tried to deliver it twice (the recipient works from home, no one showed), they lost the package for a week and then sent it back to me!!!","Dec 11, 2024",CA
1,This company has proven to be highly…,"This company has proven to be highly unreliable.Five parcels were picked up on December 5, 2024, and have yet to be delivered. The company’s website attributes the delay to heavy rain in the Gold Coast area; however, this claim is demonstrably false.Sendle offers no direct point of contact within Australia. Customer support is limited to an online chat and a call center operated offshore, making it impossible to escalate concerns effectively. When we requested contact information for their Australian office, no such details were provided. Instead, we were met with repeated assurances that an “investigation is underway,” with no clear resolution in sight.These parcels were intended as Christmas gifts for clients and remain undelivered, with no indication of their whereabouts. This lack of accountability and transparency has left us frustrated and unable to seek timely assistance.We strongly advise others to avoid using this company and will be reporting their conduct to the ACCC for further investigation.","Jan 07, 2025",AU
1,Can I give negative!,"What an inept company, brutal service, they didn't even try to deliver my package and sent me a picture saying its a large location a tourist destination. It went to the hub and back to my house. They blamed me for their default setting of leave in a safe space.

1,Absolute garbage,"Ordered 10 days ago, they took 10 days to pick it up, then quoted another 12 days to deliver it.  I paid for expedited shipping!!!

I will NEVER use them or buy from a company that uses them.","Dec 15, 2024",CA
1,Package never picked up,"Since CP is on strike I had to look for an alternative to get my Xmas package shipped. It was easy to book a pickup online but day 1 came and went....no pick up. By day 4 and no updates from Sendle and the pack still not picked up, I had to cancel because it is now past the cutoff date to make it to the destination by Christmas. Very poor communication. They shouldn't have accepted my booking knowing how backlogged their orders are.","Dec 12, 2024",CA
1,Incompetent and Unable to speak to a Human,"Every package allegedly delivered via Sendle to our small townhouse complex of 10 units, is dumped in our ""open to the street"" rubbish bin enclosure outside the complex gates on the driveway. In many cases parcels have just been stolen or disappeared. There is an easily accessible pedestrian gate for the courier to deliver parcels to the correct unit number however this would require actually doing his job and putting in a bit of effort to walk a bit further, so obviously it's just easier to jump out of the van and dump it in the rubbish bin enclosure than actually deliver it to the correct townhouse door. Lazy, incompetent and unprofessional. A few residents have lodged complaints but nothing changes and I was actually told the drivers endeavour to leave parcels in a safe place!  On what planet is an outside rubbish bin enclosure a safe place when it should be delivered to the actual unit number addressed clearly on the parcels. It is pure laziness and lack of care. I am fed up with this happening as are several other residents here in this complex. We will be taking our complaints about Sendle to the ACCC as they are operating their business in a shonky dishonest lazy incompetent way and are virtually impossible to speak to. AVOID USING SENDLE AT ALL COSTS.","Jan 08, 2025",AU

1,SENDLE MISSED PICKUP 3 DAYS IN A ROW & STILL COUNTING... EPIC FAIL,"Shocking first time experience using Sendle on Ebay: At closest (& only) Sendle drop off point in Redfern, system was down & unable to scan parcel. Asked me to come back but still not fixed by end of day. I notified Sendle re problem, found next closest location & dropped off parcel in Surry Hills... 72 HOURS LATER - PARCEL HASNT MOVED & SYSTEM FAILURE AT 1ST LOCATION STILL NOT FIXED. Followed up with Sendle Help every day - they keep telling me a driver is assigned & due to collect that day. Original delivery timeframe 4-5 days but now on DAY FOUR & precisely ZERO progress. Ebay promotes these clowns as preferred suppliers which is totally crazy when they're this useless!! Conveniently Ebay will hold my payment til delivery is confirmed & no hope of being paid before Christmas now which is the whole reason I sold the item!! 72hrs delay is unacceptable & still counting! How can drivers get away with not bothering to complete a booking 3 DAYS IN A ROW??? This should NOT happen!! First AND last time I'll use Sendle - even Australia Post is more efficient & that's saying something! Sendle's pathetic performance reflects badly on Ebay sellers & will probably provoke bad feedback from my buyer who is sadly unlikely to see his purchase in time for Christmas. Thanks a lot Sendle!!","Dec 19, 2024",GR

1,Absolutely awful.,"Absolutely awful.For one package they picked up, which had expensive camera equipment in it, they actually opened the package and separated the camera parts into two different shipments without any communication. I received some of the parts in new packaging, and had no idea for a few days where the other parts were.Then for other pickups, they just don't show up for days, and eventually after I cancel and use aus psot instead, they send multiple pickup drivers to my house over a week later.","Nov 20, 2024",AU

1,Just don’t- send your item via carrier…,"Just don’t- send your item via carrier pigeon it will get there quicker and more honestly. I have been waiting for an item for well over 2 weeks sent from within Australia. The courier has lied straight up about attempting to deliver- no one attended our property that day and we were home. They were also instructed to leave on the verandah- no one did or leave a card like they said they did. Trying to get a redelivery is awe full service. No phone service, no response to helpbot, and finally they got back to me after I submitted, I will admit, sarcastic comments and finally said I was going to consumer affairs. No apology, no sign of package coming and I don’t actually believe that the courier will come to our house and drop item off as requested.","Dec 03, 2024",AU
1,My experience with this shipping…,"My experience with this shipping company was very disappointing. While the initial price seemed attractive, the service fell far short of expectations. I booked a shipment and scheduled an appointment to receive the package after 3 days, but 8 days later, there was still no progress or action from the company.This delay caused frustration, and the recipient ultimately canceled the order.

1,Caution. Very long delivery times from Perth.,"The delivery time from Perth to anywhere is ridiculously long.  The stress it causes me as a casual eBay seller is not worth it.  Be cautious that if you ask for an investigation into a non-delivered package, they take longer by taking 7 days to find the parcel. If not located you can claim on their insurance but this will cover refunding the buyer not the additional missing item.","Oct 24, 2024",AU
1,"Lack of tracking, extra charges, missing parcels","1. Their local drop off spot says they don’t have a contract with Sendle and  that they shouldn’t be on Sendles website as such.

Have parcel sitting now 7 days in their system with no updates. 3. Missing parcels marked delivered. I’m not a huge shipper. Shipped 5: 2 marked delivered (1 missing), 1 out for delivery, and 2 in transit as I write this. Prices are okay, but time to check out other shipping options.","Dec 09, 2024",CA
1,If there was a zero category it would…,"If there was a zero category it would be for these delivery bros from Brisbane.  They basically have a a half baked tracking system that is so understaffed that after waiting a hour on chat to speak to some one I gave up.  They also have by default ""Authority to Release"" as the standard rate and if the shipper wants a signature it's an extra $5.  The problem is there is an epedemic of parcel thefts everywhere, an the building I live in is no exception.  On top of that they are a virtual company who hires courier companies who have couriers on contract.  These bros are just trying to scape a little off the top and provide virtually nothing.My package was ""on delivery"" according to their website for close to 48 consecutively with a couple of trips back to a depot 70 miles away.  They blame this on increased volume, but none of the 5 other couriers I use weekly do not say this.  They also game the review sites to get better ratings by hiring people to write positive reviews.

I “communicated” through their support websites live chat with a representative, and after they started explaining themselves and asking for patience they removed my ability to send responses in the chat, so don’t bother reaching out if you have problems.

1,"Not reliable, potential exploitation.","Sendle is not a reliable service, not turning up on expected day often, extremely narrow accepted package dimensions. Limited customer service when something goes wrong. I've also noted recently they have dropped their rates. This starts to ring alarm bells for me, not enticing me to use them again.

Couriers Please are also to blame as they are the actual courier that Sendle organised to pick up the parcel in question, they have a bad enough reputation in themselves.Sendle did give me my money back after I complained the second time, but what's the point of the service if they don't even pick up the parcel?

We are Lot 11 and are on a two road corner, when we buy online we use our address and also state the two road corner we are on. The drives that Sendle use to deliver parcels are so incompetent they go to number 11 which is a vacate block, get confused backup and drop of at number 9 on the front step, and call this delivered. This is a ongoing problem which I am sure I am not the only one who has this happen to them. I am now going to try to only use the corner of the two roads as my address for my deliveries let see if they still can't find me.","Nov 01, 2024",AU

I had to chase up every single update, they never took initiative to talk to me. I ended up telling them how much of a piece of crap (worded differently) company they are and I don’t ever do that. Never gave the initiative to give me notice when it was delivered. I of course had to send an email to let them know. Full of laziness, disorganisation and lack of training.","Oct 01, 2024",AU

Or follow their own guidelines/promises that they'll send a dedicated driver to pick up if items haven't been collected on time. A pick up time from 8am-6pm is just ridiculous. No small business I know opens at 8am and closes at 6pm. I have my driver's mobile number and most times he won't even respond if I ask if he's still picking up. Being a sole operator I'm stuck at my office all day till he turns up -- that is, IF he turns up. A simple response to my text would be fine, but no, he simply can't be bothered to tell me he's not coming. There goes another day that I'm held captive at my premises. It's extremely frustrating.","Aug 31, 2023",AU

2,Not Worth the Trouble,"I am US based and started using Sendle for our Amazon/eBay business through Shipstation. Unlike some of the other reviews, they use USPS and not their own drivers.  The ""Good"" is:1) The pricing very competitive especially on small packages.2) They provide insurance on packages.The ""Bad"" is:1) They will only provide their tracking numbers and this confuses Amazon and eBay Customers.2) eBay and Amazon, once they see that tracking number will provide no support on delivery issues and forces the seller to issue an immediate credit.3) Sendle will NOT provide information on Claims that you file.  This is unaccepatable and over time what we found out is that they hide this information because they rarely provide any refunds.  Before writing this review, gave them multiple opportunities to address.In the end, if you are selling on Amazon or eBay they are not worth the trouble.","Jan 04, 2024",US

My parcel was about to get back to sender for wrong adress even if I confirmed it right 4 times in the previous days. I had to jump through some crazy hoops to have someone call me... because you can't call them, to have them try again by following instructions they had all along. Finally made it a few days late.

But, here's the kicker: they have no idea who the third party that has your stuff is. That's why they don't provide any tracking: they simply have no idea who has got your parcel. eBay sellers need to stop using this awful service, and I need to be much smarter in spotting sellers who use them and simply not buying from them.","Apr 26, 2024",AU

On top of the delay, the franchisee (I suppose) had the audacity to put a note on the tracking page saying the driver was there to pick up the package but the package was not available which is a white lie because the package was left outside, marked & labelled the night before. The company not only does'nt care about your delays but makes up false excuses. Also only webchat available for any follow-ups, no phone number. Finally cancelled my pickup and used another service.

This actually happened before but against my better judgement, I used the company again.Also if you decide after waiting over a week for a pickup to just go drop it off, well, you can’t do that. You will have to void the label and buy a new one because pickup labels are apparently different than drop off ones?

1,the pits of deliver services,"sendle is the pits of delivery services. i’ve never not had an issue, whether it’s deliveries not being collected for weeks or things arriving too late, they manage to mess everything up. a lot of the time it'll even say it's onboard for delivery but not be delivered for 2-3 days later. pay the extra couple of dollars and use another service, especially if you’re shipping to customers, it’ll just cost you more in losing customers and replying to complaints.","Apr 28, 2023",AU

That is it. I will be filing complaints and reviews in other ways until sendle redecides their policy. Highly unprofessional to require this, honestly I wish I knew about it before I chose sendle 3 years ago to start doing business with.Oh and that is on top of also requiring your banking information and routing number to receive potential compensation for the claim.

If there is no where safe to leave the parcel when you are not home, there is no option for you to collect it from a collection point. I was advised in my area (inner city of a capital city) there were no collection points. They also cannot leave parcels at Australia Post, or any other collection point. 4. You cannot specify a time for delivery. 5. They hold parcels for 5 days before returning to the sender. 6.

I have given them so many opportunities to show they have picked up their act but they don’t even supply scanners or anything that can print off a proof of drop off so when your parcel goes missing you haven’t a leg to stand on . Then when you complain they say they are investigating . The investigation never finishes , that’s because it never starts . They haven’t got one professional side of the business . I have no idea why the government hasn’t closed them down . There isn’t even a phone line to enquire or call . You get stuck with a robot going round and round in circles . It’s only a matter of time before they are held accountable for the appaulling service they charge for but not provide . I can’t give a single positive for sendle .

I could not believe how many negative reviews there were in such a short time frame. I actually convinced myself my item was lost like the rest of the lost orders and had since purchased the same product but with a company who uses Australia Post.

Two weeks later, I still haven't received my item even though I submitted an ""investigation"" online to track where my parcel is. I couldn't even contact a customer service rep to discuss my issue as they don't have a phone number, and their 24/7 chat online assistance is basically ChatGPT with canned responses.Moving forward, I'd rather pay extra for a reliable shipper such as Australia Post for peace of mind, than save a bit of money but never receive my product!

1,Absolutely disgusting service.,"Absolutely disgusting service.Bought an item from Dandenong Victoria, the company sent it via Sendle to my address which was only 3 hours away. I was given a tracking number. I watched the item sit at the courier depot for a week, then allegedly sent. You can’t speak to anyone at all, you can’t click on the late parcel button until it is late by their standards. Then they change the delivery date again to a few more days. I call the company I bought the item from to let them know not to use Sendle and I get a crappy response from them about manpower, Black Friday and Xmas. I bought the item a week or more before Black Friday.Then I complain via their email, I feel all I get are bots talking back to me. Told to wait, investigation pending.They picked the package up 15 days ago and it is still not here. No one can tell me where it is.In this day and age you can scan a package and get a rough idea where it is.I will never use this service and I will let anyone who wants to listen know how bad they are and how bad the customer service is. I have an update. After 67 messages between Sendle and about 26 since they picked up the package, they have marked it lost. Even though during all the messages they said they had an idea it was with another courier company they used. Not once did I get a phone call, details of the other company etc until the end. They use a company that used to be called IPEC. They were also impossible to contact. I was on hold for 27 minutes and not one conversation with a human.

According to the tracking number I was given, the box never left the original warehouse in Australia.However, when the box did not arrive in New Zealand, and when Sendle allegedly searched for it - it was unable to be found.Immediately Sendle refunded my shipping cost - & I mean immediately.On following further through the refund process, I was advised that the receipts I provided were not enough.  The receipts needed to each have my address and be signed with a notarised statutory declaration.The contents of the box were valued at $500, but Sendle would only refund $100, and only if the above conditions were met.Each communication was via email and was clearly automated.

1,Terrible,"I've been using sendle for several years now and when they are good they are fantastic but when they are not they are a dismal failure. I stupidly waited a week for a package to be picked up. During that week I was told by their ""help/customer service"" that they would escalate the pick up with their partner courier service. I soon came to realise this was mainly an automated response and complete nonsense. I ended up contacting the courier company directly to be told that they had received an inquiry from sendle that day. So, despite all their promises of escalating and doing all they can to rectify the problem they did nothing of the sort for a whole week. 5 times they told me this. The following week I tried using them again, thinking it was just a glitch in their system. It was no glitch and the package was not picked up. I have now learnt my lesson and will go back to Aus.

Well, it was accessible and ready for pickup. I asked for a more versed courier to pick it up and a new pickup date was scheduled the following day. I got a message, it could not be picked up, but it will be picked up soon. Friday (!) it was still sitting there, my customer waiting for his delivery. I sent another message and clearly their support is now AI based, I was told there were several pickup attempts which basically is a lie as I have security cameras and there was no attempt. I asked for my money back and was told after a few unsuccessful pickup attempts they usually do not refund the money, but they will generously make an exception for me...How easy it is nowadays with using AI to lose a long standing customer and the many contacts that customer got them over the years.

1,DON'T USE COURIERS PLEASE,"Update to the review below. After being contacted by Sendle they followed up and launched an investigation with Couriers Please. Evidently the driver has been stood down. I have not heard from Couriers Please as Sendle said I would or seen evidence of outcomes.I'd leave a zero star rating if I could.After chasing my parcel which SENDLE took 5 weeks to have delivered, within Australia, there was no reason given for the delay despite the sender lodging an investigation. It was delivered today by COURIERS PLEASE for SENDLE As usual the driver threw the package containing $87 of product in a glass bottle from my gate onto my tiled porch. I saw him do it and called out to stop, but he fled. I then lodged my third driver complaint this year, for the same behaviour with COURIERS PLEASE. There is never any outcome, just excuses and usually a demand for my camera footage.I was then sent an email from SENDLE asking me to rate them. I did this and tried to submit it and their site refused it indicating I had not filled out 1 box with drop down options. No matter what option I chose it wouldn't accept any, so I couldn't submit my feedback. I then tried the online chat which also blocked any requests for help or a contact option. I have camera footage, photos and screenshots of today's dual company substandard service and damage. This time I'm going to see what government department oversees these 2 companies trading in Australia and lodge an investigation.It would help if Sendle stopped choosing the cheapest pricepoint for them,  as it's a costly and time consuming choice for us.","Jun 10, 2023",AU

There rates are the cheapest - cheaper than direct carrier labels and an account is always free, so next time instead of ordering package shipment labels directly through the carrier (unless in special circumstances such as signature required or special insurance needed) it makes the most sense to create a free Sendle account and use Sendle ONLY for those packages.","Jul 05, 2023",US

One package did not leave Australia and was sent back- no explanation has been provided, despite this being ""escalated""!3. Sendle LACKS ANY VISBILITY with international suppliers and is NOT WILLING to follow through with those suppliers to get detailed responses - Sendle does NOT take ANY ownership whatsoever once packages have left their hands and given to LOCAL OR INTERNATIONAL DELIVERY SUPPLIERS.4. Sendle has offered NO EXPLANATION why their Sendle POLICIES were NOT FOLLOWED prior to the 6 packages all leaving Sendle's hands - ie weighing and checking sizes of packages and charging extra if required (if that was the issue- STILL UNKNOWN)?5. Sendle states that I should be tracking the international leg of my packages trip via local delivery supplier - however when the tracking numbers were supplied there was NO INFORMATION supplied ie NO VISIBILITY! 6. Sendle stated they were following it up when the lack of tracking information was pointed out - BUT THAT was OBVIOUSLY A LIE.7. Sendle then eventually supplied 2 different delivery carriers for each package (each with different tracking numbers!!!) and told me to contact them for information on where my packages were!8. Sendle kept passing me from one support agent to another, saying it was being escalated, providing the same placating non-information AND THEN I find out that the packages have been processed for return. Why did Sendle not take that window of opportunity to resolve the issue with the packages in London prior to the return process to Sydney commenced?9.Sendle are now stating that there is no opportunity to intercept once the return to send process has commenced. They state Sendle has NO VISIBILITY - thus obviously NO RESPONSIBILITY OR WILLING TO TAKE OWNERSHIP of the issue!!!10. Sendle DOES NOT KNOW WHY it is now taking 90-120 days to get the packages back to Sydney even though it did not take that length of time to supposedly arrive in London (plus I was originally told only 90 days- why now 120 days??)11. Sendle is NOT OFFERING to arrange for the packages to be return to London when they arrive back in Sydney.Sendle has not taken any ownership, lacks any visibility for international deliveries, is not willing to esclate and define a solution- THEY DO NOT CARE!","Jun 06, 2024",GB

Out of nearly $2.5K in shipping labels I’ve had to cancel almost 20% and send with Australia Post directly. Of the ones that were fulfilled by Sendle, more than half were picked up late- sometimes up to a week late. There have been multiple instances of the courier marking the item as “not ready for collection” when it was and justifying missed pickups by blaming me- their customer. And multiple instances of them stating “no one was there to receive the parcel” when the receiver was home or “incorrect address” when no attempt has been made to call the receiver to clarify how to find them (in a building of 6 units). So many excuses for what is truly terrible service. I’m unhappy and so are my customers which reflects terribly on me and my business. If you run a business, don’t use Sendle.","Apr 24, 2023",AU

1,DO NOT USE - THE WORST,"Sendle used to be great, I would use them for everything. Over the past twelve months, they are the worst company I have ever dealt with. If you sell via eBay Sendle delays sending the shipping information to the transport company, resulting in failed pickups. You contact Sendle online staff and they are useless. They are no longer based in Australia, and instead, you get the same lies and deception every single time. Most recently I sent a package from Brisbane to Darwin, it was not collected for four days due to Sendle failed systems and 28 days later the item still remains undelivered and Sendle has no idea where it is. Bypass Sendle and deal directly with the transport company when booking, Sendle is the worst business in Australia. After 33 days and Sendle state they have lost my parcel. It is important to remember that the reputation of good courier businesses like Couriers Please, who are very efficient, prompt, and courteous, are being tarnished by the incompetence of Sendle - Sendle are only a 'booking service' for couriers, they take the cream off the top and it is the courier companies that do all the work, whereas Sendle - employees all based overseas - steal money from Australian's and then take 33-days to tell you that they have lost your parcel. The amount of stress these pieces of human effluent inflict upon people is immense - DO NOT USE SENDLE, THEY ARE THE WORST, GO DIRECTLY TO COURIERS PLEASE.

There is no way to actually ‘speak’ to a representative apart from through a chat box. Over a 2 week period I dealt with 4 different people who were unable to help me track down my parcel, or advise when it would be delivered. On four separate occasions I asked for the matter to be escalated and to speak to a supervisor but no-one was willing to speak to me. The supplier of the goods stepped in to try to resolve the farcical situation and organised a new delivery with AusPost which arrived today without incident. Sendle have still not answered my query or contacted me in any way. I was told I would receive an email which has never arrived. Instead, my online query just now says ‘case closed’. They created the problem and then wiped their hands of it without any customer resolution or satisfaction. Shocking customer service. Avoid like the plague.","Jan 19, 2023",AU
1,Sendle is the worst,Day 3 and still no contact or pick up from @sendle. It was booked to be picked up on 17/1. I've tried messaging their website but the chat bot refers me to the FAQ- that's no help. The messages on Messenger are the same. I've emailed and got an automated response that they'll reply in 2 days!!Posted on their FB page and I get a reply saying that my area mustn't be serviced by them. I live in North Sydney so this is not true. This just shows how appalling their service is. Instead of asking me any details to resolve the complaint they make excuses. Mind you - they've charged me $26 for the pick up. I imagine they'll also ignore my messages for a refund!Absolutely worst service. No phone number to ring to get this resolved,"Jan 18, 2023",AU

My gates were wide open, and the family would have been heard and seen as we were all mowing and gardening.  The driver instead chose to leave the parcel in front of my mailbox (it's at the end of the driveway adjacent to the footpath), and took a photograph as evidence of delivery.  Oddly enough, a parcel sat next to the footpath on a main, busy street was stolen. Sendle takes no responsibility, and has suggested I provide instruction for their drivers in the future - apparently they have no issue with the location of the drop-off.  This was a Christmas present, and now I'm left with no parcel, no accountability from Sendle, and a flat refusal to compensate me. Customer 'service' was extremely difficult to use, and their communication style relies on accusing the customer of wrong-doing.This was my first experience of the company and I'll never use them again.","Dec 24, 2022",AU

Firstly, the delivery lead times are ridiculous. 7 days to get a parcel from Katoomba to the Sydney CBD? I could walk up and back 3 times in 7 days. Secondly, their website tracking is useless. The only parcel tracking I had access to was ""estimated delivery between the 2nd December and the 7th December"". What?? How is that meant to be helpful. Thirdly, no status change or updates at all during that delivery window...and no further communication on the progress of my delivery. Finally, once again, even with 7 days to get a parcel from Katoomba to Sydney CBD that was beyond Sendle and so 7 days later I am still waiting for my parcel....and have just been told that their internal review of my missing parcel report will take 5 days. What??? Sendle is a complete and utter joke. Their website and logistics tracking feels like it is from the 1990s and their customer service is completely non-existent. If you are a business, please don't use them to send your products to your customers as it is a nightmare for us and will only damage your brand.","Dec 07, 2022",AU

1,Worst courier service,"Made a sale on eBay and chose Sendle's ""Printer-Free Parcel Pickup"". Followed all the instructions, writing the tracking code and address on the parcel as required. The day my parcel was schedule to be picked up, I waited at home all day. The courier never showed up. Instead they recorded an ""attempt"" and stated that the parcel wasn't ready to be collected. A complete lie. I contacted both eBay and Sendle via ""live chat"", and after 8hrs they finally responded and said they would reschedule the pickup for the following day. The courier actually came the following day, but refused to take my parcel, saying that I must print the label. I explained I had purchased the label-free pickup, but the courier would not listen. They told me that a label-free service didn't exist and that Sendle was wrong, and then they just left. I contacted Sendle again, and after another significant delay they rescheduled pickup again for the next day, this time guaranteeing that the courier would not reject the parcel again and that they would be explicitly informed that I do not need to have a printed label on the parcel. The next day the courier comes and rejects the parcel again. More explaining from me, more rejection from the courier and they just leave without my parcel. I contact Sendle again and they just reschedule...Three days wasted and my customer is no closer to receiving their order.This is an absolute deflection of any responsibility, with no care or consideration for customers. Really unacceptable for any service industry. And I would add that eBay was equally useless in assisting in the matter, absolving themselves of any responsibility for facilitating the Sendle ""service"" and just deflecting the onus back onto Sendle, all the while taking a commission of the sale.I'll also note that eBay does subtly disclose caveats to the printer-free pickup service (you really have to look hard for them). This service is only available in certain suburbs, and my suburb was included in the service area. Moving forward, I would avoid Sendle at all costs, and after almost 12 years selling on eBay, I will be taking my business elsewhere.","Dec 02, 2022",AU
2,Sendle - We're Good at Dropping the Ball,"Sendle have taken the approach to approve ATL (no signature deliveries) where the Sender requires a signature to ensure the item can be verified as 'delivered' as a part of their Covid Management policy (it's nearly 2023 guys - this is not an excuse anymore). As a result, I have seen an increase in the number of packages that are treated like a drop and run where the Addressee is claiming they have not got the item. This is not good for a business sending things out, particularly when the company responsible for the delivery washes their hands off any responsibility.Lately, there has also been an increase in items marked as RTS which are getting 'lost' and Sendle has gone silent on any matters relating to these. Don't expect much more than an auto responder to your message sent through their 'support' portal.Another issue they have not acted on for over 3 years since I first raised the matter with them is that there is no ticketing system that provides the Customer with any visibility on how a support request is being managed. Pro tip: Use HubSpot or some other CRM to keep a log of these yourself. Sendle have failed to ensure transparency here, which is a shame.To date, I have sent over 840 items with Sendle. In the earlier days they left others for dead. Now, they are getting more expensive than AusPost, and their service is appalling.","Dec 02, 2022",AU

1,The worst company - DO NOT USE SENDLE,Sender and receiver:Sent my toolbox sized parcel October 14th 2022 (Shouldn't be easily misplaced!)I did this as a test run as we were going to use Sendle when we moved states.Found out after 2 weeks that it was unable to be delivered with no explanation given why.Tried to update the delivery instructions but then after a month the website said was being returned.All this was found by checking the website. Sendle did not send any notifications of proceedings themselves.More time passed then I found that the parcel was unable to be located and they were carrying out an internal investigation. After this was completed they confirmed they had lost the parcel and tried to deny compensation claiming the courier had returned it to my address of sending which was false. They were unable to provide any evidence of this either.Its now 6 weeks since I sent the parcel and during this process I tried multiple times for a phone or email response. The email response takes days if you're lucky and the chat support is a bot and pretty much useless until you persist long enough to get through to what appears to be an overseas chat service.Sendle is the worst company I have ever had to deal with. It seems from other peoples reviews it's a complete lottery if your parcel will make it and then they try to weasel out of any responsibility when you follow up on this.I would never use Sendle again and would advise everyone else against it as well!,"Nov 23, 2022",AU

1,"Terrible service, drivers & application. Refuse refunds. Stay away, the cheap rates are just not worth it","I sent a parcel (vintage corningware), their driver ran over it and it arrived to the buyer in pieces! Buyer sent me the photos (tyre marks over box, corningware smashed in pieces despite double bubble wrap and stuffing in box) I forwarded the pictures to them. The parcel had $100 insurance which was the cost of the item so I claimed it from them and they said I should have a refund within a couple of weeks. I got the refund to the postage costs (roughly$15) back to my credit card in 2 days. The $100 refund however has not happened, despite numerous assurances that it will be in my bank account 'this week'....3 months+ later still no refund! They initially sent me 'proof' of refund deposit which was not much more than a piece of paper with my name on it (!!??) and they kept asking for me to check with my bank and it's not their issue???! After at least 8 emails they agreed to check on their deposit, it turns out they lost my bank details and the initial 'deposit' ""came back to them as the account details must have been wrong"". So I sent the details again (why can't they get it from my account sign up?). 2 months since the resending of details, still no refund. Only a weekly email from an overseas polite and apologetic girl who clearly has no control over their ABSOLUTELY INCOMPETENT accounts department. They clearly have no intention of refunding anything I think, so they've employed someone to send continuous apologies. It will cost them way more than $100 in loss of business and reputation, mucking around over $100. Disgusting! I'm refunding my buyer as I feel bad for them but this should not be a cost for me to wear. How are these clowns allowed to do business like this? ebay has made money from the sale, I've lost nice corningware and some poor soul is $100 out of pocket. Lets not mention the cost of the 3 month frustration having to deal with crooks.Additionally their sendle application dashboard is quite substandard. It does not include basic functionality such as account statements nor does it accurately reflect parcels sent but that's a separate issue. You get what you pay for I guess. Cheap postage costs horrible outcomes. I'll be reporting them.","Sep 29, 2022",AU

I've tried to follow up with them several times but we cannot get any help from their customer service team. Another parcel was picked up by them 10 days ago to be delivered to the location in the same city - it's missing now!

1,Terrible service,"Terrible service. Parcel not picked up and no option to escalate as the customer. Sendle don’t provide a phone number, email or online chat. Eventually escalated to sender after 2 weeks and they were able to organize for parcel to be picked up. Picked up 20/5. Now parcel has gone missing somewhere between Melbourne and Perth. Sendle do provide an option to initiate an investigation which they are now doing but will take 5 business days. Updates require going to the sendle website. No information about where the parcel is currently - is it in Melbourne still? Has it arrived in Perth? Is it somewhere else? The communication is poor, the lack of options to speak with someone is disgraceful. The tracking updates have been useless “parcel processing at depot” listed on 26/4 and 4/5 - really? Which city is that depot in? Would much rather pay a little bit more and use a company that I can communicate with for peace of mind when things go wrong. From reading other reviews it seems that parcels do go missing not infrequently and claiming the refund via the insurance that sendle provide is an extremely difficult process. Expecting I will need to escalate to consumer affairs to get a resolution which is unsatisfactory.","May 10, 2022",AU

Customer service is offshored and scripted, I was getting recycled canned responses due to the amount of times I had to complain. They are reluctant to refund or accept any responsibility. The blame the network of couriers constantly and despite me bringing to their attention the couriers were lying as I had CCTV proving they did not attempt collections, they never accept any responsibility or offer to help resolve in anyway other than to send a driver the next day.

1,"Very disappointed in Sendle. Delay tactics for a lost package meant an angry customer, lost money, and product.","I used Sendle via Ebay to send a package. I dropped if off on the 10th with an expected 3-5 day delivery time.By the 17th the customer was annoyed at the delay. I escalated to Sendle and they said it would be picked up that day. I ran (literally) down to the delivery hub to see what the status was and it was no longer there - some courier had picked it up.By the 23rd, when tracking still indicated 'at the hub' I re-escalted and they opened an investigation. I checked daily and was told by March 2nd they'd have a resolution. On March 2nd when I chased, they said they just started an investigation and updated the tracking. Part of that was to email the customer asking if they got it, and also re-re-asking the Hub if it was there. Literally the first steps that should be occurring. Oddly they asked me the race, gender, appearance of the courier that picked it up...They were clearly grasping at leads.The disappointing thing is, since the customer was already annoyed, or the Sendle email went to spam, and did not respond Sendle assumes it was received and does not pay out the insurance claim.","Mar 01, 2022",AU

1,Where do I start?,"Well, where do I start? I live in the UK and my family live in Australia, and as usual I ordered lots of different gifts for them at Christmas time.  On the 26th November 2021, I ordered a sportswear top for my son as his Christmas gift, and hadn’t received notification about it being delivered.  On the 19th December I enquired with Sendle if it had been delivered and then discovered that I’d made an error with the address, so informed Sendle of my mistake which they acknowledged and changed the delivery address.  There was no house at all at the number I had mistakenly put on the order. On the 31st December I had an email confirming that the gift had been delivered, immediately contacted my son who checked and it hadn’t been delivered so I set up an investigation with Sendle.  The “missing” parcel was found! Yaayy!! On the 9th and 10th January, the couriers attempted delivery at the property where there was no house! So I contacted Sendle again through the live chat and whilst on the chat, a very helpful customer happiness team member named Lucille, sent an email to their couriers telling them of the correct address.  On the 11th January the tracking page was updated and nothing happened at all. I informed Lucille that my son was moving house on Friday 14th Jan so it would have to delivered before then.  Today, they have delivered his Christmas gift, you guessed it right, to the address where there isn’t a house, so they left it at a completely different address on the same street! It is with absolute luck that the lady who took the delivery, phoned my son and he has now been and collected the parcel.  The thing I find most odd is that my sons phone number was on the parcel but at no time, in the 4 times that Sendle’s third party couriers were trying to deliver to a none existent property, have they picked up the phone and asked what the correct address was!! There are some serious practices that need reviewing and updating with Sendle and their partner couriers.  Totally unacceptable and terrible parcel delivery service! Avoid!","Jan 17, 2022",GB

Not a surprise anymore but of course with a cherry on top and my parcel is most likely stolen now…So Sendle sent me an email on the 9th of December saying that the parcel was delivered but I actually never received it at all and lodge a complain with them now - still waiting for a response.Also, one time they dumb another one of my parcels outside on a street near the door in front of the apartment building besides that we have a concierge who could open the door but also I was home for the whole day that day but the delivery person didn’t even try calling intercom, he/she just left my items outside on a street where random people could steal it, luckily my husband came home and picked it up from outside (that time I thought, okay things happen and it’s not stollen so I decided not to report it). BUT now it’s getting really annoying. Sendle is very irresponsible company, the delivery people just don’t care if anyone steals parcels. Well, this time I couldn’t sit quiet, everyone needs to know what this company does.I’m not sure why companies still use their mailing services as they have quite bad reviews on google and other review online platforms, and seems people have the same problem like I have now. Horrible mailing company, if you have a business, don't upset your customers, don’t use this Sendle company please. You better of paying extra but send it with care and you will have happy consumers.

1,Lost my family's Xmas presents.,"I sent a box full of Christmas presents with Sendle in late October (got myself organised early for once given that postage is so delayed everywhere). Expected delivery time was 2-3 weeks (it's a regional destination and it's COVID times so whatever, that's just how it is.)It took 6 days after pickup from my doorstep for it even to appear as in transit with the tracking note ""Your parcel has arrived at the depot for delivery in the next available cycle"".That's unusual, not at all in line with the tracking I've had from every other parcel I've sent (including one two weeks earlier to the same destination). Those all updated after pickup with the message ""Transfer to xxxx"". This other update looks more like a note for when it reaches the destination depot, not the source. 10 hours later it gets another ""In transit"" update with no note. This is the last time any update appeared for this parcel.2 weeks later, the expected delivery window has completely passed and I launch a missing parcel enquiry. It takes 10 days for Sendle to perform their ""investigation process"" which I suspect is where they do mostly nothing while their website automatically moves a progress bar every day or 2 to give you the impression something is happening.At the end of the 10 day ""investigation"" the receiver is sent an email asking if they got the parcel, which obviously they did not. So Sendle notify me I'm getting a refund for the shipping (still yet to see the actual funds though). Thanks Sendle, very cool. Guess my family's not getting their presents this year. Based on the weird tracking, they're probably sitting under the pickup driver's tree.Safe to say I won't be using Sendle ever again.","Nov 26, 2021",AU

1,Do NOT use Sendle,"Do not be swayed by what appears to be cheap delivery pricing. The process for booking a delivery with Sendle is easy. However, my pickup was late. The delivery time was long. Weeks not days. The deliverer did not follow the delivery instructions to leave at the receiver's door and instead 'left a card' claiming there was nobody home. From there everything got worse. As the sender I did not receive any advice that the delivery had not occurred. I only knew that package had not arrived after the receiver lodged a complaint. I requested a redelivery and it was only then that it was discovered that the package could not be located. Sendle did appear to conduct a thorough search, however, the package has not been located. I now have to issue refund for the item to the receiver (my obligation and OK), I receive a token refund of the delivery fee and maybe a token refund for the cost of the item.

I had sent an email to Sendle requesting more information about insurance and never heard back.We went ahead with booking our first delivery anyway. Our store was open, receptionist at the front of the store. Our front door is glass. We were clearly open, yet we got an email saying our parcels couldn't be picked up? We even have private parking, there is no excuse. Our cameras and our receptionist have verified that nobody ever even approached our building to try and collect.I complained on the 15th of October asking for a refund.

1,Just awful service,"I work and live in a large complex that has a reception that is attended during business hours. This means that deliveries can be made even when I am not there. This usually works well and even AusPost can get it right.I recently made an online purchase only to find that it had been given to Sendle / Couriers Please (I cant work out which does what) for delivery. I knew that I would be away for a week but naively thought that a courier would be able to work out how to deliver an item to a reception area. No such luck.Sendle/Couriers Please made one attempt to deliver the item apparently couldn't work out how to deliver it to reception and sent me a sms to tell me to collect the item from a depot ""within five days"" or else the item would be returned to sender. I am not nearby - I cant get to the depot in five days.Impossible to contact the courier - I get a ""we are very busy at the moment, but will try and get back to you"" type message.So now, the item will hopefully be returned to the sender. I will have to arrange with the sender to send the item back to me (using AusPost this time).This is not the first time that I have had a problem with this mob. Had I known that they were the preferred courier I would have either instructed the sender to use AusPost or I would not have made the online purchase.I would not recommend using Sendle/Couriers Please under any circumstances.More than a week of trying to contact Sendle and so far no response - its like there is nobody there - difficult to understand how to get assistance at all.

Very coincidental!,Finally received a refund of my freight cost but they will not allow a claim for the lost item even though I paid extra for insurance.They again do not reply to my emails.I had to send a replacement item at my cost to the customer and used Australia Post this time.Customer received the item without any issues.Will use Australia Post in future and pay the extra.Much cheaper for me than replacing the item and losing money.","Dec 27, 2021",AU

1,"SENDLE FRAUD, FAKE : NO ACTION ON LOST PARCEL","This is further to my previous review of Sendle. After at least 20 reminders to Sendle, they have not returned with any satisfactory answer. They said today that my two parcels SXR7HTN & SFPQ3JX were delivered and they sent me two fake pictures of doors they said the parcels were delivered. The recipients, both Professors of repute did not get it. These were books, each costing $32 plus shipping cost. Today, after reminders after reminders, Sendle sent me a note saying they would refund me $7 which does not even cover the two parcel shipping costs. What a joke ! I cannot reach them as all their so-called Customer Happiness Champions are Philippines-based and they have no idea about Australia. It is a scam, fraud, and full of deceptive conduct. There are no phone numbers I could call them. I asked them to call me.... no reply.They did not also respond to unlawful debit of my credit card on the plea that one of the parcels was bigger. It can't be as all my parcels were of the same size and weight.  They are nothing but thieves. If you ever have complaints to make and if you hear from these people ( Vera, Jackie, Paulo, and Ralph --- perhaps fake names), you can bet these are fake people from the Philippines. Stay away from Sendle. Go to Australia Post even if it costs you some extra dollars. I really wonder how on earth this fake, fraud and scam company can run in Australia.

I have had to apologise multiple times to the receiver who needs the item immediately, which I shouldnt have to do! I have specifically stayed home every single day all day since booking the collection to ensure I'm here for it to be collected, which has greatly impacted my work and life. Sendle is an absolute joke and I can only imagine they'll go out of business soon enough if this is how they run their busiess. There are already 2500 1 star reviews on here with similar complaints which comes as no surprise - The writing is on the wall. If zero stars was an option, that would still be too many.

So, if you're having an issue, as I am today - you're f***ed.I really needed this parcel to go TODAY so that the buyer gets their goods on Mon- Tues, but obviously this is not going to happen as now the parcel can only get picked up on Monday (today is Friday).Useless service, won't be using again.

1,Complete liars who never collected anything,Logged 5 packages over a 2 week period for pickup - not one was picked up when booked (or at all in the end).Contacted Sendle reputedly and was told every time this would be resolved and items would be picked up that day.After almost 2 weeks of being told this we discovered locally that their courier partners in our town is closed due to COVID and have 2 months worth of undelivered packages in a warehouse in town (yet they still tried to tell me they were getting it pickup up - total lie)Ended up cancelling and using Aus Post - will never use again.

Signed up for MyPost Business account and you get the same price as Sendle but peace of mind that your items will be delivered on time and in one piece.The claim process is a joke and worst thing is that they fabricated evidence that the item was delivered on 26th August. I lodged a claim on 31st and they started looking in trucks and warehouses - why would you do that when you claim to have delivered the parcel on 26th??This is criminal behaviour and I'll be taking them to Consumer Affairs - not for damages for but criminal behaviour.,"Sep 22, 2021",AU

1,Time to talk to Consumer Affairs and get my money back,A waste of time and money. I'm going to Consumer Affairs. Feels like I'm being scammed. This has been a terrible experience and I do not recommend this to anyone. I picked Sendle because the prices were cheaper than Australia Post and someone could pick up from my home. What a complete farce. Took money from me quickly enough but I'm still waiting on the service I paid for. I will be going back to Australia Post because at least they have 7 days a week customer service online and on the phone and they've always refunded me when I've been able to prove that issues were not my fault.I've had a few small parcels ready to go for nearly a week. The courier keeps marking that the pick up was 'futile' (which means the courier is saying they tried to pick up the items but were unable to...doesn't say why though). I carefully followed all the requirements for pick up and this keeps happening. No one has been to my home in the past week to pick up any parcels so either the system they use is faulty or someone is being dishonest. I have had parcels delivered from other couriers with no problem. Sendle customer service doesn't operate on weekends and it takes them 1-2 days to get back to you. Incredibly unprofessional and I will not be using them or recommending them to anyone.,"Sep 19, 2021",AU

1,Poor Experience with Sendle.,"My package was registered online with Sendle and left at the front door for collection with a Sendle label. Sendle sent a courier to collect the package, who did not arrive on the specified day. Sendle then sent a “dedicated” courier to collect the package the following day. When I checked with the recipient the following week I found that it was not delivered. I requested an investigation and Sendle denied that they had collected the package. Then Sendle also claimed that as it was not properly registered by their courier, they refused to send me insurance claim forms.  We were home during this entire period and never informed us of any problem. After 3 weeks, I  insisted on an additional search and to their credit the package actually turned up and was finally delivered a month late. So, in essence they collected the package, lost it, denied me the insurance cover that I paid for because they did not record the collection correctly. Significant failures for a courier company. They were difficult to communicate with, have no telephone contacts on their website and their “Customer Happiness Champions” were only interested in covering up Sendle’s failures. Will not be using them again.","Sep 16, 2021",AU

Don't expect all of those pickups to happen though, and don't bother following up with support if a pickup driver doesn't turn up.You can email them anytime, just don't ever expect a response, well, not within a week anyway. They have a live chat available for a few hours per day, but it's not always available when it should be. If you do manage to get onto the live chat the customer service can't provide more info than you can see on your dashboard and can't do anything except ""pass your feedback on"".

I tried calling, took the option for a call back that never came and then went round and round their phone queue with no one ever answering, an hour later I hung up. I then sent a support request which has also been ignored.So perhaps Sendle need to use better couriers (Couriers Please) but either way I paid for my goods and I paid for delivery. I eventually tried looking at the tracking and it has given me an option to request redelivery, why they don't give you that option in the attempted delivery email I don't know... So now I wait to see if they may or may not attempt to deliver again...So a day later...After requesting redelivery I get a text message from a random mobile number referencing somebody I have never heard of telling me my parcel is ready for collection at some random newsagents that is luckily when I look them up on Google I can see the connection to the company I bought from and also luckily for me I guess the newsagent is within a 5km radius of my home...I have never had such a bad experience with delivery, If I could give them a zero I would.","Aug 19, 2021",AU

We had taken additional insurance which does not cover it because the package was delivered.  They cannot tell us where it was delivered too or placed I would not recommend them to anyone.  You cannot call them to discuss problems everything via email and mostly you receive a standard reply with no thought put into it.,"Aug 04, 2021",AU
2,No real ability to help,"Booked something with Aramex which was then supposed to be picked up the next day. When it was not picked up I contacted them and was told that the driver had scanned in that they turned up to collect the package but it was not ready. No-one actually turned up as I was sitting in a room looking over the only entrance to the property and next to the door that they would have had to knock on. I suspect that the lazy so-and-so of a driver simply drove past or perhaps didn't even do that. Contacted Sendle and it's clear that they have no ability to really do much to help as they are at the mercy of the courier company and they clearly have no influence or power in the matter.I like the idea of Sendle but you have no choice over the courier company and if you end up with someone rubbish like Aramex, there's not much they can do to help you.","Aug 04, 2021",AU

1,There is NO guarantee and Terrible service,"Job: SJDW6D8I have been using SENDLE since they began in Australia some years ago and at first the operation was fabulous however over the last year there has been SO many lost parcels, unscanned parcels, parcels delivered to the wrong address and the most recent (despite me handing the parcel to the driver personally) parcels that have been deemed by SENDLE as ""no proof of pick up""!Of at least 7 instances of misappropriated deliveries and lost items, only 1 has been honoured with their guarantee of covering lost costs. they say throughout the website that pick ups are not guaranteed to be scanned due to ""broken scanners..... etc"" BUT without a scan there is no guarantee that the parcel is picked up (unless you have security footage). This is just 1 example and an example of what I am currently going through. They are dishonest and will get out of any guarantee anyway they can. They have no honour, they take no accountability and they really do NOT care in the slightest about servicing your business.  They communicate in circles with generic emails and tell you to use their automated ""CHAT"" service which DOES NOT WORK. You can't call them and you are at their complete mercy.  I have made the decision to stop using SENDLE as they do not value my business and are completely disrespectful.","Jul 23, 2021",AU

Watched mail delivery person stop at the mailbox and place mail inside. When I got the mail, no package. Waited for an hour after the time for delivery that was posted then went to the post office and asked them if the driver had come back yet. Was told that the driver was a temp and didn't know the route. So went back and waited in hopes that the package would still be delivered. Around 3:35pm I received a message that the package was undeliverable. Waited again for a bit before going back to the post office to see if the package was there. It was.

Obviously it wasn't, and I was home all day to receive the package, but they took my package to their depot anyway. After contacting a Sendle Customer Happiness Champion, the champion asked if it was ok that I picked up my package from the depot 20 minutes away. I said no it wasn't ok, as I had paid for shipping to my home and didn't want to make a 45 minute round trip. As an alternative they sent my package to a newsagent... 20 minutes away. Cool! Thanks!

I recently gave them another try and in the space of one week, they delivered a shipment to Germany instead of India, damaged a fragile spirit level way beyond usability and then failed to allow me to do a claim on it as I was 1 business day past their bull$#*! 10 business day limit (I was away over Easter and missed their stupid deadline by a day) and also failed to collect my items for 3 days straight.

1,Use Amazon instead,"I am sure they are carbon neutral because they only drive from depot to agents and don't even try to deliver to the recipient. Much less kilometres to drive! I had the usual story, ordered something on Etsy, got notifications so made sure I am home, only to get an email that package has been left at a newsagent. There was no phone call, no doorbell rang and no card left. The agent is located over a kilometre away. I live in a Sydney inner city suburb. I am physically restricted and the cost of getting the package from the agent is larger than the value of the goods I ordered, around $50.Customer service doesn't answer in days, and says they can do nothing once the package has been ""delivered"", which doesn't mean delivered to recipient, just delivered somewhere. Unfortunately, I will have to resort to Amazon who are the clear winner with their reliable delivery service.","Apr 16, 2021",AU

It takes about 50 steps to navigate where to get help. The bigger the company gets the worse they get. Parcels go missing often and then they launch an 'investigation' which never amounts to anything and the parcel and it's contents are never to be seen again. I get my $5 shipping cost refunded every time but honestly it's such a hassle even getting in touch with someone at Sendle to help it's not worth. It's worth spending the extra $2 per package and use Aus post- can speak to an actual person whenever you need.,"Apr 16, 2021",AU

1,What's the point,"I have never had my parcels delivered with Sendle / CouriersPlease, because their couriers just immediately drop them off somewhere at the depot without even trying to actually provide the service I've paid for. No approaching the house and ringing the doorbell, no knock, heck not even leaving re-delivery cards. Never mind that the house is never empty and most of the residents work from home and have a full view of the street / driveway. You simply do not deliver it to the address, ever.

1,After using Sendle for the last couple…,"After using Sendle for the last couple of years, I am done with it. You book in a parcel and it is arranged to be collected the next day. However 90% of the time nobody shows up. You are not notified of anything and are left wondering what is going on. You email customer service and they send the same generic responses to you every single time. The last time this happened, they said the problem was because I had not left any notes when I booked the collection and that the courier did not understand how to collect parcels from an apartment. How ridiculous.You can also opt for dropping the parcels off somewhere, instead of waiting for a collection. Which in theory sounds good. However I have had so much trouble with this as well. There is a map on the Sendle website which supoosedly tells you where the drop-off locations are. On more than one occasion, I have travelled to these places and they have told me 'oh, we are not sure why we are on their website because it is nothing to do with us'.I am now looking for alternatives because I can't put up with it anymore.","Apr 14, 2021",AU

Also they will charge you again when you have already paid up to 25kg and 0.1m3 for a package as it changes in their system and says 0.1gram then they will weigh measure and charge you again. I have also found that when receiving a parcel it is dropped off at parcel collection agency that is supposed to be close to your home but is not and they actually never attempted delivery as you were home the whole time with the door open when receiving sorry we missed you, no card been left another reason why I know the did not even attempt to deliver.

They ""promised' to collect Monday-still NO collection and all the excuses from SENDLE'S overly enthusiastic (well trained BTW) under the sun. Here we are, Tuesday. I have asked to speak to management....more excuses. Still no pickup. Meanwhile, I have a frustrated customer waiting on there parcel and I am left making excuses thanks to SENDLE.  Their service is beyond average....the communication is all smoke and mirrors,  'mystery' couriers that don't turn up and say they have (it seems the customer is never right in their eyes) and chain of communication with multiple reps with inept ability to understand the problem and put a solution into action.

I have absolutely no regrets in calling you and your associate businesses a supply chain of jerks. I am not going to spare you fools this time. Enough of dealing with you monkeys.Enough is enough! Screw you and your administration teams. You deserve these comments and I do not care if I offend you from the ground level all the way up to the CEO of your hierarchy. Morons!Heres another one with proof of what you have done! Now if you have a tiny bit of respect left in you, you should step down. You doofus's need to be taught a lesson by current affairs and ombudsmanYou owe me and my customers a call and a letter of personal apology for failing to deliver on time. Own your mess you team of incapables!Explain to me and my customers in writing what were you doing with those individual packages entrusted to you all this timeNot your generic email you would have been sending to all your clients!Shameless creatures!Care contacting my customers to apologise or your crappy brands ego is too big to apologise for your mess?You are a group of irresponsible people Simon Martin, James Chin Moody and all your chain of command. You are putting reputation of other businesses at stake and should be held accountable for the damage you are doing to other businesses. This should go on current affairs and to court of law. I shall file a complain with ombudsmen for your negligent behaviour!Would you care getting back to me incompetents? It's been days since the issue was escalated. Are you kidding me?Are you penalising your customers for your own mistake? No contact with my customers so far. 2 weeks and my parcel is probably still at the drop off facility. If I was your chair I would fire you all incompetents. You guys deserved to be dragged in mud. All of youIt has been 2 weeks since drop off. No updates on this. But rest assured I will write you personal letters containing all those praises and send it to you via registered post. PinheadsCan you please tell James Chin Moody, Sean Geoghegan , Simon Martin and all of your team members that you are all an association of clowns who have absolutely no respect for customers or services. You are filthy people to deal with...With due curses and well deserved foul language(Prohibited due to facebook policy but you totally can imagine them). You can return my goods nowLet me escalate this to both ombudsmen and current affairs. I am going to write them personal letters and to magazines. Shall leave you all lasting impression... I will personally write to news editors for this","Dec 24, 2020",AU

Right now, I still have not received it. To me it's a lousy excuse for having forgotten it or perhaps lost it.  Ahhh and a threat of sending it back to sender. I wonder how they do that!?

1,Terrible - Avoid,"Review by Michael Pollak is spot on.Ordered Christmas gifts from a Melbourne vendor (I'm in Sydney) on the 29th November. Pick-up was scheduled for the 7th December, was not picked up. Picked up on the 8th and parcel has been ""in transit"" for a week. No updates since then. It is now past its due delivery date. And for Sendle to look into it will require another 5 business days. No number to call for assistance, emails take ages to get a response, meanwhile both the seller and I are in limbo. I don't even know where my parcel is or if I'm going to get these gifts in time for Christmas. Paid for delivery and this is what I got.AusPost is awful but at least you can follow up with them and as a corporation they have some accountability. Never ever use Sendle as a seller or buyer.Edited to add: Opened an investigation into it on Thursday a day after it was due to be delivered and after getting zero responses from customer service, today Sunday it was mysteriously ""found at depot"" and is now ""onboard for delivery"". God knows how long the parcel would have been stuck at the depot if they weren't forced to look into it? I have now spent half the day waiting for the package and am FUMING that I am now having to waste my Sunday at home waiting for this package that is already LATE. No tracking beyond ""in transit"" and ""on board for delivery"" the entire time, pathetic service why does a delivery company not have any kind of GPS tracking. I have no idea when the parcel is arriving and can't leave my house in case I miss it and the package is sent straight back to the vendor (this has also happened before since they have no distribution centre like AusPost). Sendle is absolutely trash, I've lost faith in the vendor as well for using them. Avoid at all costs, don't risk your business and customer service on this pathetic delivery service.","Dec 20, 2020",AU
1,First and last time,"Poor process this middleman doesn't seem to know how to track and send packages but quick to take money. Sent Syd to Darwin three weeks ago pre Christmas rush and package still hasn't arrived. To top it off no visibility beyond having been picked up and being in transit. That level of detail is useless. I want to know picked up by who, crossed border, at warehouse etc so my customer has more certainty over status.Sendle decided a phone number wasn't important and that their team can just copy and paste generic info. If a big organisation like Auspost can manage customer service surely Sendle can if they wanted to but guess they decided not important.Best to avoid this company as they will damage your reputation and leave you extremely frustrated and pissed off","Dec 19, 2020",AU

This in almost all instances appears that this means using fastway or couriers please. These two companies have abhorrent reputations and are  well known to be the absolute worst in the business.Use Sendle by all means if you 1 Want your parcel to have a higher than normal proabability to get lost or stolen or arrive chronically late.2  Like having little or no recourse to get any compensation for lost or stolen items.3 You like almost no customer service whatsoever and you enjoy having no phone number to call.4 You just generally hate yourself and want to burden yourself with voluminous amounts of stress.","Dec 19, 2020",AU

I have left clear pickup instructions and we have cameras around the house. Now 3 days later it’s weekend and next potential pickup is on Monday.

Sendle did not even have a customer representative to answer phones, I never received a call back after leaving messages.  I put in a lost parcel ticket with no response back after that was put in.  I would NEVER use this company to ship items and I would hope that companies would steer clear of this company as well since they lose or deliver late.  Very frustrating!!","Dec 18, 2020",US

We waited all day and the driver didn't turn up. Contacted the support people who said they would reschedule. Didn't get a confirmation email and my dashboard was not updated with new delivery details so I had to follow up with them. It's now past the pick-up cutoff time and again it hasn't been picked up with no communication from Sendle about it. Again I have emailed to find out what is happening. With no phone number to call it's very frustrating and not a good experience from a sender point of view. This is disappointing as we have found them quite good when we have received parcels.

Both times my parcels have been lost, I've had to launch an investigation and I've had to wait double the proposed length of time in order to get my package. In fact it's been a whole month now and I'm still waiting for a package to arrive that was sent from VIC to NSW. The first time I had to drive an hour out of my way in order to go to the depot where my parcel was left. Sendle are completely useless for delivering parcels in semi-rural or rural areas.Australia Post delivers to my letterbox, or my door without any issues. I would not use this service for anything important or anything that you actually want to have delivered in a proposed timeframe. 2 thumbs down.","Nov 21, 2020",AU

1,SEEMS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE BECAUSE IT…,"SEEMS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE BECAUSE IT IS!!I have used Sendle with no issues for about a month, thought it was great until I started to have issues. I booked to parcels for pick up on Monday the 16th of Nov. One parcel was picked up, the other left there, I thought it was strange but thought they would come back. Well I was wrong. They haven't. I looked at the tracking and It said ""an attempt"" to pick up was made on the Tuesday (which is a crock of .. because the package had been sitting the same spot the other package was picked up from). So I contacted them since they have a 2 day pick up guarantee. I can tell you they have worded it so they never have to pay and never have to pick up your parcel. Since an ""attempt"" was made and re-scheduling was done for Wednesday, the pick up guarantee restarts again on Wednesday, so when it wasn't picked up on Wednesday they have Thursday to pick it up and say that they attempted and the cycle repeats itself. It could take weeks for the package to be picked up and theres nothing I can do about it.","Nov 18, 2020",AU
5,Love Sendle!,"Sendle is great! It's easy to use and connects to Shopify and Etsy, which are my two main platforms I sell on. I love that it's carbon neutral and also supports USPS.

1,Sendle are clearly a scam company,"Sendle are clearly a scam company. I demanded a phone number when my package went missing and days later the reply I was given was that they don't have a phone number due to the amount of cases they have to handle. 'Cases' being COMPLAINTS. I have seen numerous reviews of lost packages and I have security camera footage proof mine was never delivered, despite it being marked as such. EBay sellers seem fond of using this cheap service to save a few dollars, but it's not worth it. By Australian Consumer Law all businesses are required to have a phone contact, so I don't know how they can get around this, but I have referred the matter to my lawyers. It's not about the package anymore. This company's dodgy policies, horrid customer service and see-through excuses have convinced me they need to be taken out of business. I'll also be alerting consumer watchdog to look into this scam of a courier service.","Nov 02, 2020",US

1,Give Sendle a miss. Not the company they used to be,"Booked the parcel on Thursday, October 22 to go literally 45 minutes away. Printed the docket and left it outside as per my instructions, as I usually do. I was informed via my dashboard later that evening that the parcel pickup was delayed and it would be rescheduled for Friday the 23rd. I was travelling intrastate on that day so left my gates open so the Couriers Please courier could get the parcel. I arrived back to the office on Monday the 26th to find I'd had a delivery from Couriers Please but the parcel I wanted to send was still sitting there. I lodged a customer enquiry stating the above, got the standard email reply that the couriers had been alerted and it would be rescheduled for pickup. The next day, Tuesday the 27th, it sat there all day and still wasn't picked up. I notified sendle again by replying to the previous days' email. No response has been rec'd from customer service at this point apart from the obligatory auto-response that the courier has been alerted to the issue. It's now Wednesday the 28th and it is still sitting at my despatch area and not a word from Sendle.I have used sendle for a fair while and I have given them 5 star reviews in the past but recently they have been really slow in getting parcels picked up. This would be the third time I have had this experience, but the other two times it was Fastways that didn't arrive but it was picked up on the third day. This instance has been a week tomorrow that my parcel has been sitting here and no one from Sendle has made any contact with me for an apology or an explanation as to the delay. I'm not sure what part of the system has broken down but clearly, the organisation isn't what it was, so I will try and source something better from here on in. I'd suggest everyone give sendle a miss if you need a reliable service. They are actually making Australia Post look a much better proposition at this point.","Oct 28, 2020",AU

1,"If you want things to never reach their destination, these guys are it!","My partner and I have used this company numerous times despite their lack of knowing what fast delivery is. We have use them for just under 100 parcels so far and I can count on 1 hand how many times parcels have been picked up within 5 days of confirmation of pick up. When asked for some reimbursement of some sort due to clients not wanting our product due to it not even leaving our residence, they completely ignore you. Would have a better chance of throwing your parcel in the bin and hope it stops in Perth.","Sep 16, 2020",AU

They are even worse than Australia Post - and that says something.","Sep 16, 2020",AU
1,"Awful service, Courier company that does not deliver!",A company that is incapable of fulling deliveries to customers and tarnishing businesses reputation. I have recently made three separate purchases from three different sellers and alas none of them have been delivered. The issue: Fastway/Aramex driver can not locate the address! We are a company that receives multiple deliveries a day from various couriers who find our location with ease. Sendle's lack of ability to listen to feedback and use couriers that are reputable results in a service they can not provide. I am still waiting to hear back from Sendle as customer support has not responded. Customer support still have not answered my support ticket since the 8th of September and two parcels are still waiting to be delivered for over a month.

Home all day, in the evening checked the website to discover that the parcel had apparently been delivered that afternoon. No sign of it anywhere, not by our street-front door, nor in the clearly visible letterbox.Lodged a missing parcel investigation with Sendle and observed online as over a week they went through steps to ""investigate"" then declared the parcel lost. No attempt to let me know where the courier left the parcel.Never had a parcel go missing either with AP or direct from couriers (and it would have been obvious from picking up the parcel that it wasn't something particularly desirable to steal!).I had read reviews of Sendle and decided not to use their service for my Ebay sales.

1,📦🚛TERRIBLE SERVICE 🚛📦,📦🚛TERRIBLE SERVICE 🚛📦That was the first time using Sendle for my online store and will NEVER use them again. Using this service has meant my customer has not received their order in nearly a month. I have had to refund them for their order. It has cost me close to $40 in the fee to Sendle and the item was NEVER picked up and now had to pay $50 to Australia Post on top of that. 1. I admit I made the mistake of not having the full address when booking my label because it pulled the address form my website directly. 2. Sendle misinformed me twice to say that someone attempted to collect - they couldn't have with NO address to go too.3. They should have called me to clarify - this is why we provide a contact phone number.4. After so many emails (they have NO phone support) Sendle told me this had been escalated and would be collected FOUR (4) times!! 5. I have now gone to Australia Post to send via Express post so this is costing me more.6. I have had to refund my customer.7. I would like to request a full cash refund (not a credit note) from Sendle and make a complaint at the appalling service. So much for the Sendle pick up guarantee. I would not recommend this service.,"Sep 12, 2020",AU

1,Worst customer service I've had from a shipping company,"Had a parcel picked up and sent out for delivery the next day, only to find that on the tracking it said that it was undelivered, even though I was home. They then tried a few hours later and had the same update. When this happened I sent an email enquiring about the issue. The following day they tried another 2 times, both with the same outcome. Getting pretty frustrated, I wanted some contact with Sendle as they had not gotten back to me, only to find out there was no phone number to call! I sent a message to them through Facebook but still no response. It was only after I had publicly commented on their Instagram post that I had any sort of contact with Sendle, days after the first contact I had made. Finally got to emailing them, and was then told it would take 1-2 days to re-deliver the parcel. I asked if there was any way it could come before the weekend as I had been waiting for days at this point, and their response was that there is no guarantee. I finally got my parcel today, after the 5th attempt and 6 days after the first delivery attempt when it should have arrived. Do not use Sendle, if anything goes wrong with the delivery process, their customer support is very much lacking, with no phone number to ring, no response from direct messages, and an email turnaround time of 2 days, unless you negatively comment on their Instagram post like I did (and many others too. It seems I am far from the only person with this sort of issue with Sendle).","Sep 08, 2020",AU

I had 4 lost or not delivered parcels in that time. For a saving of $1 to $1.50 per parcel it was not worth it.Very bad service and would not recommend to anyone trying to run a business.

More than a week later the package was still at the depot and I was then told that as the delivery was being arranged by a delivery partner there wasn't much they can do.

I have also received 4 or 5 packages using them. They just chuck it in mailbox if it fits or on my stairs. So glad i found out about this company from a Gumtree ad. I am only posting this cos i saw bad reviews on here and cos my experience was good i never thought to review cos u typically only review when its bad but my experience was just so good i had to review.

1,Sendle seem to have lost The Plot,"Sendle seem to have lost The Plot. I was impressed with their excellent service in the beginning and let people know. Sadly, I am unable to do that this time.Delivery was attempted on Sat 8th August. The Couriers Please driver left a TOTALLY BLANK calling card in my letterbox that I only discovered after a random check of the mailbox later that afternoon. The company had Authority To Leave The Parcel Safe If No One Home. I was home but the driver didn't care enough to slide the bolt on the gate to the right to enter the property and knock on my front door. After discovering the card, I was somewhat confused so checked my email. Eventually I received an email telling me their attempt to deliver had failed and they left me a card. The email advised that I had to request a redelivery with Authority To Leave.. (which they already had) So I went through the process, got told by return automated response that it would delay the delivery by one extra business day while my request was processed. So I accepted that would make it a Tuesday delivery. Afraid not, A further check of my email and there was an email informing me that they had delivered my parcel to their collection point in my area. So now I had to go and collect it. I eventually collected it on Thursday the 13th. Sendle sent me a further email late Thursday or Friday announcing that my parcel had been delivered and invited me to leave a review with a link to their website. The link failed to execute correctly. So not to be defeated, Here is the review Sendle so enthusiastically requested. On further investigation, I discovered that my parcel had been delivered to the collection point on the Saturday at around about the same time I was advised I would have to request a redelivery. What a pathetic display of incompetence. The thing is, I don't need Sendle to make my life more frustrating by taking the delivery booking then passing it on to Couriers Please. I wanted to ring Sendle on the Saturday but no number on offer. I can book my deliveries direct with Couriers Please and still get the same poor service because I've experienced it in the past. However, they at least offer a contact number should you need to call them. The poor service and appalling communication and incorrect advice from Sendle is common through the industry and it is slowly but surely undermining consumer confidence with purchasing on line. Delivery times are being extended and we must not lose sight of the fact that the consumer is paying for the poor delivery service. The seller of the product also takes a hit to their reputation as a result of Sendles (in this case) appalling service. Stop hiding behind the internet Sendle and talk to your customers. Make it easy for your customers to get information and advise you that you are performing poorly in instances such as my recent experience.","Aug 16, 2020",AU

After a failed attempt at delivery, I requested redelivery to my work address via their tracking website. After 48 hours it came back as saying this was not a service they provided. Several attempts were made via their Help Bot to get assistance. Finally, after a week I had a human reply from a ""Customer Happiness Champion"", who just reiterated the problem with the AusPost address and offered no assistance in getting it redelivered. Simply stated that it would be returned to sender. DO NOT USE SENDLE.","Jul 31, 2020",AU

1,As An Ebayer,"As An Ebayer, I thought It would be good to save customers money for shipping.Worst Mistake I could have made !!- No pick ups for over a week after marked  for shipping !!   ( I suspect every-time you add another parcel they   delay the pick up to save money )- Customers Complaining- Lost Parcels- No Driver ( Fastway Reporting for pick ups )- No Phone Service- Parcels sitting Idle going nowhereEven after reporting issues to Ebay and directly to the management of Sendle ( yes personally communicated with me as I forced a contact through Linked In ), all promises to resolve issues fell on deaf ears.Their contact with Fastway is so Poor, I accidentally bumped into the driver making another delivery aver the road and he was unaware he had 12 parcels across the road to pick up. Other times the driver thinks he had one parcel when there were up to 16 parcels to be picked up. ( this would be more proof the reporting system is not advising the driver of the correct number of parcels to be collected if they get the advice at all !! )You cannot fix a broke system if you simply cannot be bothered but like I stated to Sendle, without a phone service to resolve these issues, they will never be a real delivery service that can compete with the slightly more expensive Australia Post.I cannot see how they were integrated into Ebay with such poor service, even when they fail to pick up after days, you cannot use the same label to take to a drop off centre !! I gave them a good go and a lot of constructive feedback, all that was totally ignored with political automated email answers.Dont waste your time if you want reliability.My experience is based on sending 187 parcels with SENDLE in the last 5 months and sending over 500 with AUS Post in the same time frame.","Jul 07, 2020",AU

Tracking revealed they'd had the parcel for at least half a month but had done nothing at all until the dispute had been raised. If I hadn't raised a dispute and the seller hadn't chased I guess it'd have sat their forever.

It is now 11 days since pick up and it is still not delivered and now we have all the easter public holidays.

After investigation by sendle turns out they send me a photo of the parcel being loaded in the truck in THEIR WAREHOUSE as a proof of delivery. In short parcel was never delivered, they just decided the parcel was deemed lost and encourage me to seek refund from seller. THE PARCEL IS LITERALLY SITTING IN THEIR TRUCK WAITING TO BE DELIVERED, but no they decided it's lost so that's that.After seeing the number of negative reviews on them on multiple website, I say they are due for class action, I will be in touch with my attorney to seek a legal way to solve this matter given their absolutely horrendous track record and complete lack of care for their customers.

They deem an open try Ute as acceptable transport to deliver valuable goods in?I at least expect my courier to have a van or truck to deliver my goods safely.They then tell me that they cannot insure for damaged product and as I said it's not been damaged, it was neglected! I'm in shock that someone would be so stupid to drive around with other people's product swimming in the back of their Ute. Anyway why would you use Sendle, they loose parcels, have no customer service and do not integrate with Xero. All to save $1 per parcel. Just pay for EParcel and Fastways at least you know your product is safe and with Starshipit the integration is seamless and super user friendly!","Feb 11, 2020",AU
1,Terrible service- DO NOT USE,This business only allows 5 days for parcel pick up. I asked for a 2 day extension and was refused. I think the parcel collection time frame is unreasonable. 2 extra days is not a lot to ask. I will never use this service again and will tell everyone I know never to use them.,"Feb 11, 2020",ID
2,WARNING!,"WARNING!Businesses, take extreme caution when approaching to use sendle, they can be detrimental to your business & CustomersSendle services are good until you have an issue.The Largest let down with Sendle is FastWay couriers, not like INTERPARCEL, you cannot choose who your carrier can be, Sendle automatically allocates a carrier for you, if you are automatically allocated FASTWAY, LOOKOUT!FASTWAY have continued to lie, ALMOST every time we have a parcel pick up with FASTWAY being automatically allocated, the following happens over 95% of the time,1-	Major delays in having the item picked up.2-	FASTWAY have lied about attempting to pick the item up, we are a retailer, hours are 9am-5pm Monday- Friday, 2x staff members always rostered on ,how they can outright lie about the attempted unsuccessful pick during our open retail hours is beyond me.3-	Sendle want YOU to prove to them, that the driver is lying and did not at all attempt the pick up at the specific time stipulated. Are the vans not GPS TRACKED? Sendle want you to pull yourself away from running your business for a service in which you are paying for to investigate for them how the FASTWY DRIVER is lying AND incompetent.4-	Sendles customer service is SLOW and Appalling, they do not have a contact number, to raise a complaint you need to email Sendle then wait 24hrs for a reply, far toooooo long if you have an disgruntled customer.Sendle obviously do not value you as a customer as much as you value you own customers.Also, if your payment declines for some reason, Sendle lock you out completely, you cannot go back and view past PAID FOR deliveries or Deliveries currently in transit, surely this is against consumer law.There are many more services apart from sendle, Sendle may offer good rates, but when there is an issue, it becomes very costly.This is a reply to Sendle's responseWow, this is unbelievable that you have been able to reply so quickly to a negative review. Usually it takes 24 hours just to receive a response to a complaint, so this is a record and a first for Sendle. Just so you are aware, this issue that we've raised is almost 2 weeks old and was only escalated yesterday, a time frame that is unacceptable and not how any professional business should run.","Feb 12, 2020",AU

1,Extremely disappointed with this…,"Extremely disappointed with this service. Initially attracted to Sendle due to their pickup guarantee. What a false claim ! I booked a job to be picked up on the 4th of Jan. After it didn't get picked up we saw an automatic status that said as much and that it was being rebooked for the next day. However, still no pickup, so by the middle of the 3rd day, we sent a support enquiry asking what's going on. Sendle replied they are escalating with the pickup provider. By 8th of Jan, we had enough and cancelled the order. Our customer has been chasing delivery of their much needed items and this is reflecting poorly on us. All claims about sending a dedicated pickup driver never eventuated. This is false advertising and I'm pretty sure it's illegal to make such claims and not follow through. If Couriers Please (their pickup partner) is not up to the task, they should stop using Couriers Please and switch companies. Surely, such bad practices would leave customers with a bad taste in the mouth and in turn result in negative feedback (like this). Or maybe, they simply don't want to service small businesses, despite their claims otherwise.All in all, very, very bad experience.","Feb 07, 2020",AU

I would never use this service again. My package is still waiting to be picked up but I'm just going to go via Australia Post on Monday. I am extremely disappointed in sendle,"Feb 07, 2020",AU
1,I was really excited to use Sendle but…,"I was really excited to use Sendle but it’s been a terrible experience so far. My item wasn’t picked up the first day I scheduled, it got to the end of the second day and I messaged customer service and they said the delivery driver had come but there was no item and asked me to clarify my address and send photos of my house and links to google maps. I said I had been home and no one entered my property, advised the address was correct and provided the information that was requested. The “customer happiness champion” said they would reschedule for the next day and they ignored my question about other options to send and concerns for my customer or for me as a customer. It got to half way through the third day and my item still had not been picked up, I contacted the happiness champion again and asked if there were other options if my item was would not be picked up again, they said they can’t guarantee my item would be picked up and would understand if I wanted to use another service. Are you serious, you don’t even bother to try and resolve the situation and are perfectly happy to lose a customer, obviously if this isn’t resolved I wouldn’t return and would leave negative feedback and that’s the kind of thing you are content with? I said just to clarify the only way I can send is with my item being picked up and you can’t guarantee it will, and I was just advised I can drop off, but I would have to cancel this order, print another label and book to have my item dropped off. I’m so unhappy, I was so keen to use the service I even wasted $25 on the compostable packaging. I’m upset my item still hasn’t been picked up and furious at the lack of care or help or resolution from the customer happiness champion, what a joke","Feb 07, 2020",AU

It was at my front door for two days!

I have since checked my security camera footage, and besides the deliveries I received, no other visitors to the house on either of those two days.

SENDLE has terrible customer service - they use templated replies and no escalation process - or rather the head of customer service who I had to fight to get hold of just stops replying to emails - so clearly the rot is at the top down. They have lost $1000's worth of my product and always manage to fob me off and pull out another term and condition or loophole of some description. Honestly there are so many better companies out there - do yourself a favour and chose anyone of them except SENDLE, and do your network a favour too by spreading the word that this company is not worthy of your or their business. 70% of people who have reviewed them on here have given them the very worst rating possible - which shows that I am not an isolated case.","Jan 29, 2020",AU

This is for parcels marked with authority to leave.Followed up with Sendle's ""customer support"" and they said they would arrange re-delivery of the item, so the courier goes to the Newsagent, picks up the parcel and then delivers it back to the Newsagent 2 days later. Have asked them for a refund but they said they can't do that.

1,7 days wasted on waiting and praying for pickup,"Hmm... 6 days now, and my parcel is still sitting at the front door waiting. I wonder someone from the neighborhood may even act quicker than Sendle, and take it before them show up..Still, today there’s no one showed up after the 6th time I scheduled/rescheduled the pick up. Don’t know whether tomorrow will have any luck They should really put this on the headline of their website, “we guarantee it takes at least 7days to pick up ur parcel”.And still haven’t seen any of their so-called dedicated driver, who supposed to come the first time when they missed it. I don’t know why they make it sound like such a great privilege and bonus of their service, as they resend someone to pick it up if it doesn’t get collected on the first place.Come on! You’re a courier, that’s what the customers pay for: PICK UP THE PARCEL! So of course you’re gonna re-attempt if you didn’t even come pick up on the scheduled date (don’t tell me the customers should pay extra, when you didn’t even show up). And not to mention it’s taking at least 7 BUSINESS DAYS to do it. What a joke!For people haven’t dealt with them yet, just don’t bother & don’t waste your time.BTW, some of the positive reviews here I’m not sure whether they are 100% genuine or doesn’t have any interest or relation with Sendle.This is how I see it, correct me if I’m wrong. When people have a positive feedback, most of them may share with their friends in life, but they won’t be bothered to go on websites, register/log in, and then write a review about it.Most of the case, people will only go through these pains when they’re really upset about some terrible service/quality, and they can’t wait to let out their anger & warn others.Just saying, many positive reviews are written by people who only write 1 REVIEW, and that review is an absolutely AMAZING experience with sendle.They would register an account just to appraise sendle?????

4,It is what they say,"For what Sendle says they are, they do a good job with a few caveats. Having dealt with the frustration of Australia Post I can't say Sendle is worse.Sendle advertises that they resell spare capacity in the system. To that end when there is none, e.g. Christmas, they will struggle to achieve it.Second, you get a lower price but they are not an express delivery service. If capacity is low parcels can get delayed. If you need certainty of time, use another provider.Similarly, if your business is sending hundreds of parcels a month, Sendle may not be the right option. You may be able to build a relationship with an alternate provider with small if any pricing differential.Unfortunately their dependence on third parties has its own complexity but overall so far the service has been what they said. It isn't perfect, but it is aggressively priced.","Jan 13, 2020",AU
1,How many escalations does it take???? - update,"I have been chasing a pick up from a Hubbed location for over week now - it has been there for 12days!!  It has been ‘escalated’ 6 times now and they still haven’t picked - completely unacceptable and they still can’t guarantee pick up date - meanwhile our customers are furious and we will lose business.Sendle have refunded the shipping but still haven’t picked up not guaranteed a pick up date.Update 13th Jan - Sendle can still not guarantee a pick up date after another 2 escalations! so we picked up the goods after 2 weeks - I now have to rebook, relabel and get this because they refunded the shipping the first time (which went nowhere as it wasn’t picked up) when we rebook we will be charged the normal price with no compensation despite the hours we have wasted on this pitiful service A regular business customer of 3 years and this is it!","Jan 13, 2020",AU
2,Well so far I've been watching my order…,"Well so far I've been watching my order from Sydney to Perth, not picked up Monday when it was supposed to be, has only just be collected Friday morning! I'm a customer of a store in Sydney that will probably lose my business because they use sendle. Sendle even stated that they had designated a driver for pickup for Wednesday and it still wasn't done. So then I thought maybe if I ring them I can pick it up from a depo in Perth, to speed things up a bit, but they don't have a number to call. They are definitely not user friendly. Will see if the stick to their 5-7 working days delivery time. If they don't I'll change my review to 1 star!","Jan 09, 2020",AU

1,This company is crap,"I was chased by SENDLE to deliver my parcel kept promising me pick up date that would come and go and they would give me another date which you guessed it my parcel is still sitting at my front door 7 days later and I’m only five minutes off the main road. They are so full of crap with their empty promises. So it’s of to the post office in the morning something I should have done seven days ago. I have had my customer all over me about where his package is so much for their 2 day delivery guarantee not worth the paper it’s written on.For piece of mind stay well clear of this company.It’s now three days on from when I wrote this review I have had SENDLE all over me wanting me to change my review to reflect a better image of their company in the end I did not need them to pick up the package as I lost my $180 sale after the package sat waiting for them for seven days.Now here’s the kicker yesterday they emailed me to say they didn’t pick up in my area but if I took the package down to the local printers they would pick it up from there that’s 2klms from my house and opposite the post office, the only reason I gave SENDLE a go was so I didn’t have to drive to the post office, they did return my $15.95 cost but informed me they could not compensate me for my lost sale, two days before they sent me the they couldn’t compensate me letter they sent me an email to say they where working on a way to compensate me as shown in SENDLES REPLY TO THIS REVIEW BELOW.I wouldn’t trust this company to have the capacity to deliver a paper clip.They still sending me emails saying they are trying to get their courier to pick up my parcel even though I have told them the pick up is no longer required.They just haven’t got a clue.Dale Guthrie.Beerwah Queensland Australia Dale Guthrie.","Jan 10, 2020",AU

1,My advice AVOID Sendle.  Not reputable & No integrity,"My advice, AVOID Sendle.  We’ve had them here in Australia for some time and now their expanding to ruin people’s days across the US. At least we can give our friends across the globe fair warning.  With Sendle its all good when things go smoothly, otherwise there is zero care for the customer or their goods.  Sendle will drop you quicker than a hot potato.  I sent a parcel with Sendle and they completely ignored the delivery instruction resulting in the loss of the package and despite being negligent they just wiped their hands of responsibility.  It cost me $300.  They are not a company with any integrity.  Buyer Beware.  You’ve been warned.","Jan 03, 2020",AU
1,Sendle is an absolute DISGRACE - Never Use - Avoid,"The worst courier I have ever experienced, failed to deliver my item.DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY AS A SELLER OR PURCHASER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.    I will never purchase an item on-line from any seller who uses this company as their courier.  This company did not deliver my item to my address - 17 days late & still no delivery.  Attempted to deliver my package to a large private school's kindergarten instead of my clearly marked residential address.   Sendle is an absolute disgrace.04/01/2020Please have a look below at Sendle's further incompetence, asking me for their Order Reference Number. I am not surprised this only further demonstrates that Sendle don't know their business and it is now that they want to communicate.   Sendle, I don't work for you, I ordered an item from Mr Pool Man who used Sendle as a courier.   Sendle's job was to collect a package on 16/12/2019 & deliver said package by 18/12/2019.   The item was attempted to be delivered to a kindergarten across the road of my premises with a different address, then taken back because it was the wrong address.You did not want to communicate to solve this problem with anything except token gestures at the time you lost my package, please do not send me any more requests to do your work, like you are doing now.   I am still awaiting to hear from Mr Pool Man in regard to being reimbursed for my order which I cancelled.Sendle, can you please respond publicly on this site and tell me where the package is, where is it you say it was delivered & who signed for it.?    Let the readers here decide who is telling the truth.01/06/2020Sendle, yes I have received contact from Your Customer Support Champion Farah, who has just stated that 19 days after delivery date she is going to talk to the courier driver, and this could take 5 days.   Not good enough.   Would have been nice if this was done on the day, could have avoided a lot of issues.   She informs that Sendle have a policy of leaving parcels at addresses other than the destination address.   You are going to need negative stars in your feedback request for customers to accurately describe your courier business quality of service.   Would be good if your drivers knew the difference between a private residence and a large private school complex, where they originally attempted to deliver.  Not good enough, disgraceful customer service, nowhere near good enough. You still have not responded to my questions above, in this public forum, to let the people decide on how you conduct your business.Sendle, can you please respond publicly on this site and tell me where the package is, where is it you say it was delivered & who signed for it.?    Let the readers here decide who is telling the truth====================================================11/01/2020 - latest email to the Sendle.   People You Decide - as a seller if you value your clients; as a purchaser - you want a reliable & ethical courier.Farah, (Sendles' Customer Happiness Champion)Have you found the package yet?Can you tell me if it was delivered?  if so;Can you tell me where it was delivered?Can you tell me who signed for it?These are simple questions, that only need simple replies.   Sendle, you collected the parcel on 16/01/2019, it is now 11/01/2020, still no answers in sight.   I am being asked by Mr Pool Man to return the item for a refund for a parcel you delivered to the wrong address 23/12/2019, then took the parcel away cause it needed to be signed for, then on 02/01/2020 you inform me it has been delivered and you have not provided me with where it was delivered to & inform me it has not been signed for.   (long after I cancelled the order).   It is apparent that Sendle appears to have no influence over the drivers who deliver for Sendle & it appears that the drivers will break the rule and not obtain signatures for deliveries.   This can be cleared up by answering the above 4 questions.   If you continue to avoid the questions with token answers, the people on the review page will know that your honesty and integrity will be measured by your avoidance to directly respond to fair and reasonable questions of your conduct.   Or Sendle can continue to demonstrate your disgraceful ethics by not answering questions that all customers and their clients would like to know about Sendle as a courier management company.   The seller, Mr Pool Man has lost patience with you as I have a number of emails detailing what your customer thinks of Sendle and your complete incompetence.   So stop giving me token reply’s, just answer my questions directly.   Time to do the right thing and admit that your company cannot even fulfill its core duties, being able to pick up a parcel and delivering it to a customer of your client.   COMPLETE FAIL.Please stop telling me that you will not contact me, that I need to go to your site to find out information about Sendle not doing its job, that I should search my neighborhood to find a package, that you have failed to deliver to my address.   I Don’t Work For You.   In fact Sendle was employed to deliver a package by Mr Pool Man (who you work for) and deliver it to me (Mr Pool Mans client.)I will await your response to these 4 simple questions Fahar – Not sure how you became a Customer Happiness Champion?   Time for Sendle to demonstrate some integrity.Sendle – Unreliable - Un-Contactable – Much Dumber that Ordinary PostWarren FRANCIS-PESTER====================================================19/01/2020Sendle, thank you for contacting me privately on my email, however, I like to keep my review of you in the public forum.   I just want to provide facts and then let the public decide how your performance as courier service rates.Summary Of Facts:1.   Purchased pool filter from Mr Pool Man 15/12/2019 (10 days before Xmas)2.   Sendle collected item on 16/12/20193.   Mr Pool Man's informed me that delivery would be on 18/12/20194.   Via email, 20/12/2019, checked with Mr Pool Man why parcel has not arrived - informed due to bush fires NSW a delay of 2-3 days.   No problem delivery date now expected to be 21/12/2019 - still in time fro xmas.5.   In the mean time, checked reviews on Sendle as a courier company - Reviews were scathing from purchases & sellers6.   Checked Sendle tracking on 24/12/2019 (1 day before xmas) - Informed parcel delivered, not left by Sendle, tried to deliver item to large private school, they could not obtain signature, took item away.   7.   Sendles tracking site informed me that a card had been left & to arrange re-delivery.   (Sendle later admitted in an email - that the card was left in the couriers truck at the wrong address)8.   I attempted to contact Sendle immediately, they do have provide a phone number anywhere to contact them.   I was informed by Sendle that this their policy in relation telephone calls.   You may only have contact with Sendle via a web page.   This leads to unnecessary delays.9.  According to Sendles tracking, my parcel was on the truck on 27/12/2019 and returned to the depot on 30/12/2019.   No cards left, they appear to have tried to deliver to the same private school, which is not open due to the xmas break.   Again no cards let at my address.10.   On 28/12/2019, I cancelled the order, notifying Mr Pool Man and requested a refund.   i went and purchased this item locally.11.   On 02/01/2020, i was informed via Sendle's tracking site that the item was deliver.   NOT AT MY HOUSE.   I was home.10.   I was informed by Sendle that the item was left without signature, maybe at a neighbors,  maybe under a tree and that I should search around my neighborhood.   I could not understand why Sendle refused to leave the item without signature on two occasions and the third occasion, they decided to leave this anywhere.   I did not authorise  delivery without signature.11.   They declared that their investigation was concluding, I have received not information of the results of their investigation & have asked them to provide me with answers to 4 simple questions: (i) Have you found the package yet?(ii) Can you tell me if it was delivered?  if so;(iii) Can you tell me where it was delivered?(iv)Can you tell me who signed for it?After a thorough investigation - these answers should be easy & I would like them in the public forum for all people to know.   It appears that Sendle do not like to be transparent to questions that are like to be damaging facts.12.   According to their webpage again my parcel has been declared lost, and they are providing the seller with information on how to claim a refund.  13. I contacted Mr Pool Man with copy of this email and it was at this point Mr Pool Man then provided me with a refund - 14/01/2020.  I dealt with Kc, Farah, Krystel & Rytz (Customer support Champions & manages) all useless.   It appears that they like to ask questions of recipients, but do not like to answer questions of recipients.   Sendle appear to have no moral compass, avoid responsibility and provide their clients customers with token gesture responses instead of serious answers to difficult questions in the public forum.Sendle is a disgrace as a courier firm and any business that subjects their customers to Sendle is also responsible for poor customer service.   Avoid Sendle, not should not even be a consideration for sellers or buyers.Warren Francis-Pester====================================================Hi Sendle & your Customer Happiness Champions - You say that you have conducted an investigations, still waiting for a reply in the public forum to the result of your investigation.   You have gone very quiet.   You also have failed to answer my questions for the public to see.

1,Simply do not use this service,"Simply do not use this service, if you want your package delivered. Lying customer service operators, sub-par service and ineffectual (verging on illegal) business practices.Saw this product was slightly cheaper than the Australia Post price when posting a sale from eBay. Thought it would save some time and money (supposedly can drop outside business hours). Say what you want about AusPost, this service is much, much worse.Ordered, paid for shipping. Elected drop off point. Dropped off same day. Two weeks later had not been picked up. Launched an investigation through Sendle web platform. Came back a week later 'after a thorough investigation (?), we are unable to find package'.I personally went to the drop off point and found the package within 10 seconds. I spoke to the management of the establishment and NO INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT (Strike 1: Blatant lying). I asked the attendant at the drop off point what happened. They informed that Sendle had not given them access to the POS equipment to register package but still for some reason accepted the package. This depot was listed as a point on Sendle's website (Stike 2: Ineffective service).I responded to the ticket letting them know what happened. TWO WEEKS later had not been picked up yet! (Strike 3: Terrible problem resolution). On the plus side, instantly refunded postage cost. Not really sure why they would do that if they had any intention of carrying out the duty. Cost negative feedback on the eBay profile. No remediation steps were taken by Sendle.Seriously, avoid, avoid, avoid.","Dec 24, 2019",AU

1,Late delivery 1 star rating is one too many,"Honestly 5 stars, you are joking. Delivery expected 17-19 December and still waiting. Really how does something get lost after being transferred to third party for delivery. Not one expected date of delivery has been met. There are enough ratings at both ends of the spectrum here to say this is a hit and miss courier service, good luck if you happen to hit but by crikey there seem to be a lot of misses. Not worth business reputation I would think when there are other more reliable options for the customer.Sendle reference is SK46S5 but it doesn't really matter now as have been in contact with seller for cancellation and refund. This was ordered on 5 December for Christmas so I had assumed that would be plenty of time, boy what a mistake, didn't realise at the time the seller wasn't using Auspost as the expected delivery date was 12-13 December on the sellers site. I won't be making that mistake again. Parcel has only just made it to the depot today, wherever that is and who knows how long it will take from there.","Dec 24, 2019",AU

1,Used Sendle for the first time and very disappointed,Used Sendle for the first time as I had larger parcels. They repeatedly didn’t pick up on the booked day and wanted to take only one package instead of the 2 booked. Driver was confused with it. Have wasted a lot of time waiting for them to come. I can’t leave large parcels outside the front of the house even if behind a pillar as parcels get stolen so if I have to go out to work I have no option but to take the chance of leaving them out. They are cheaper than Australia Post but service is bad.  As a seller I have to apologise for the delays to my customers that aren’t my doing.,"Dec 09, 2019",AU
1,Sendle may look good from the sender’s perspective,Sendle may look good from the sender’s perspective but the receiver is not as important it seems.

Lovely assistant there told me he hears the same issue from most people.When I sent through feedback it was a standard response - no attention to my details provided. Rather than use the feedback to improve services you get lectured on how no one could receive/ unsafe to leave at address/ you should have said it could be left unattended.All blame to person receiving the item rather than deal with their contracted couriers. Dreadful delivery and customer service.,"Dec 09, 2019",AU

When I advised them that I had used Sendle's services to retrieve auction goods in the past their customer service agent basically called me out as a LIAR!!! Sent through copy of label proving pick up & delivery from auction house (the prior email clearly stated it was the same auction house in a different state) & they returned fire with 'Apparently, the parcel from... was from a different pickup address. I was only looking for the order coming from the same address as the current order.' which was their pathetic justification for making me out to be a LIAR!!! Begrudgingly refunded payment, continue to hassle about 'whether you want us to chase this to get your parcel collected or do you want to cancel this order?' for a service they already said they do not provide & after explaining days before that I would not be wasting any more of my time or theirs expecting a decent response from them.

Each day for a week, the courier claimed the package or address could not be found. This kept getting “escalated”. I’m not sure to where because nothing ever happened. I checked and re-checked the address etc. On the 5th day of non-collection, I saw that the driver had claimed to have tried to pick up the package at 3.44 and 5.30 am. Complete lies. I was home. Nobody came. You can’t call Sendle and I know why. I started to wonder if they were a kind of a scam, or just Internet trolls. Who knows? I never talked to anyone and no one ever came.

Nothing happened, No one came, and no updates, no explanation at all  on dashboard till next morning and later morning update says ""It looks like this parcel was not picked up on the scheduled date"" when i try to reschedule again, the earliest option was after 2 days ( because of weekends?

I had one issue with a package (customers apartment was hard to find) and Sendle tried twice before sending the package back to me, notifying me all along the way.

5,Best Shipping Platform I have Found!,I just found out about Sendle a few weeks ago and it was a god send for my small e-commerce business. I ship 99.9% of my orders via USPS and send had been able to save me on average anywhere from $1.50 to $4.00 per package. That is huge at the end of a fiscal year. The platform is free to join and there are no hidden fees and the 5 tier pricing structure is super easy. I would totally recommend this platform. You have nothing to loose. You can test drive it for free and just pay the applicable shipping for the package your are sending. I am always looking for ways to save money and this helped big time to cut down on my shipping costs but also offering a more competitive price to my clients.,"Nov 27, 2019",US

1,94% one star rating pretty much says it all...,"I mean do I really need to leave a review. A company who has a 94% one-star rating pretty much says it all. I need to vent so here I go..I've stupidly used this company one too many times. I'm totally sucked in by the low cost of shipping and so are my customers. But never again. Their lack of care and responsibility is unbelievable. I'm a ceramicist and they recently handed over a delivery with 9 broken pieces. Each piece was double wrapped in bubble wrap, surrounded by shredded paper and in its own box then boxed again... seriously to break a piece you would have to be literally throwing the boxes around the depot. I've had boxes of product worth over $400 go missing, pfft, vanished, no reason, no answers and all I got back was the $30 courier fee. When there's a problem it's impossible to speak to a human, which just escalates the rage you feel to the next level.

Delivery instructions were to leave the parcel if no-one was home.Called the 1 300 number provided to ""To organise a redelivery"". The first call centre agent claimed I had to pick it up from a 'pop up store' and hung up on me when I queried why the parcel would not be redelivered as stated in the email. She did not call me back, so I called again. No joy from the second telephonist either. And, when I asked to speak with his supervisor was told I would receive a call within the hour - it never happened.Now, I have received another email stating I have to travel to a neighbouring suburb to collect a parcel I paid to be delivered.

BUT - these guys have no scanners so you have no proof it was ever picked up and when it gets lost - which is frequent - you have nothing!International deliveries are all sent to Germany first and then on to the rest of the world. Even New Zealand! This means Australia to New Zealand takes 3 weeks! I can row it quicker! And they lose International deliveries all the time - it's no wonder you cannot insure international deliveries!

They cannot bother to reply efficiently to help queries.  Last year, after a week of non-delivery I organised someone to pick it up from their Distribution Point 1 ½ hours away from me.

Now Sendle can't tell me where the package is. 2 days ago the intended receiver received a random message saying that the parcel was not being delivered due to unpaid account. I have no idea why this has happened. I presume this is because sendle has not paid whichever sub contractor has my parcel. Customer service unable to give me any indication of where parcel is.Even under these circumstances no phone customer service is possible. Just email.The previous time I tried to use sendle they emailed me in the morning to say my parcel would be picked up that day.

There are tonnes of them; this industry has low barriers to entry and thus great firms are always entering the industry looking to prove their metal. To Sendle; given the consecutive bad reviews and little reply. I would say you dont care to much for feed back.

The tracking details for this delivery state they have left a card but my client says they have not. As there is NO WAY TO CALL Sendle you have to email them and wait.

I contacted support who were basically useless. Pick ups should be prioritised after something like this happens but there was no such assistance.I thought it would be attempted the next day because they say they'll come the next day if not collected initially but apparently I needed to reschedule because the driver was hopeless. So another day wasted. New scheduled pick up day was Thursday, again nothing. I contacted support again mid afternoon but no response received before the end of the day.. get a contact number!I ended up cancelling the pick up and spent almost 2 hours driving to deliver the parcel myself.

1,BEWARE!... They lie and use the most imcompetent couriers on earth!!,"Where do I start... I purchased an Item online and received the Sendle Tracking no. All seemed good at first, 6 days went by and I noticed not one single scan on the tracking. I then contacted Sendle to voice my concern on the lack of tracking and was told they can see tracking on their end and it had passed through Gold Coast to Bendigo depot. That was a flat out lie as I discovered later. I waited and when the expected delivery time had passed I lodged an investigation (Which can take 8 days) and as the days went on, there was still no scanning so I kept voicing my concern and asking where it was and to at least give me an ETA. Still the answer I kept getting was that they couldn't tell me anything new. I then requested the courier service and consignment number which turned out to be the most useless couriers on earth...Fastway. When I checked the consignment on Fastway it said it was scanned and headed to Launceston in Tasmania over 10 days ago. So Sendle straight out lied to me when they could see through Fastway it had gone there right from the day it was picked up, not Bendigo. Don't trust these lying pieces of rubbish with your parcel. This is a $600 Item and it's missing from day one. If they had just been honest and said we stuffed up and we're trying to get it back, I wouldn't be so upset. This investigation they launch is also complete rubbish designed to buy them an extra 8 days to locate and get the parcel to you. The investigation claimed they had interviewed drivers and checked vans. What an absolute lie! It had already gone to Tasmainia, so why couldn't you have told me? Just Beware, they use Fastway and another complete incompetent courier service called Couriers Please.

Their response on Thursday was I may need to use someone else if it was urgent.  This is the second time they've done this to me.  This has cost me both time and money.

1,Customer Service.....What Customer Service?,"I'm all for industry disrupters & trying something new. So I thought I'd try Sendle with a personal package before shifting my business across. Well this potential new customer has definitely been lost. My package was due to be picked up on 17/9 between 8am-4pm. At 4:40pm no sign of courier so check my Sendle dashboard says pick rescheduled for 18/9. Oh well these thing happen I thought, & proceeded to go to an appointment leaving my house at 5:15pm. As new customer next morning thought I'd better check dashboard to see if there is anything I need to do with new pick up date - then see new status 'Futile Pickup sender not home'  WHAT!!! emailed sendle advised me they had rescheduled pick up for 19/9. Anyway with a number of emails back & forth I was disappointed to find out that Sendle do not honour their PICK-UP GUARANTEE. Apparently the courier had tried to pick up package ( but this was outside of Sendles service times 8am-4pm) but because they had tried to collect guarantee doesn't  seem to apply. All very convenient if you ask me. Why is the customer being penalised for the courier not operating within Sendles designated pick-up times. If your couriers can't work within the outlined Sendle service delivery standards that is not the fault of the customer. Sendle I am super disappointed. Your customers service & resolution process is abysmal - avoidance of answering direct questions, no explanation as to why a pickup scheduled for 17/9 is now going to be pick-up 19/9 two days later. If you value your businesses people I'd suggest you don't risk using Sendle.","Sep 18, 2019",AU
1,Miserable service,"Working with this company is a miserable experience. They have no contact information and have no ability to track down any shipment between pick-up and delivery. They have no contact information aside from an email address you can only access after using a web form. I was so displeased I wanted them to stop delivery and let me know where the package was currently so I could have a real courier service pick it up, but they had no idea where it was. I will never use any company again that works with this group.","Sep 10, 2019",AU

I'm cancelling my order with the vendor, and will stick to using anyone/thing but sendle to send my own businesses parcels.I'm confident sendle charged the vendor for the parcel already, and seem to follow an obscene American business model that  enjoys butchering the English language with self-inflating hype, rather than just doing what they say they are so great at.They aren't","Sep 08, 2019",AU

As a receiver: They couldn't organise a domestic delivery within 4 days, so  decided to drive and pick up myself. I drove for more than an hour to Couriers Please pick up station and I was told that parcels were with the driver and not at the depo, so basically I wasted two hours of driving for nothing. Couriers Please managed to organise the courier to deliver at the same address within an hour. This is not a first time that Sendle lets me down.They don't have phone support. Very disappointed.","Aug 23, 2019",AU
1,"A very poor domestic service, let down by sub-standard delivery partners","We trialed Sendle for sending domestic Australian orders from our online store a few years ago. In the first week there were so many issues and we spent so much time trying to solve them that it became immediately apparent that it wasn't a great service. The problem seemed to be the delivery partners, in our area they are Couriers Please and Fastway. They weren't even bothering to attempt to deliver parcels in some cases. After about 3 issues in a week we canned Sendle and let their customer service know how bad our experience was and they were very apologetic and took our feedback on board. Cut to 2019 and their international service is better, but the domestic service is still TERRIBLE. As of today I've waited three days for a courier to pick up a parcel from our premises where I've been in attendance the entire time. On the third day the courier has 'attempted' a pick-up which is a complete lie - nobody rocked up and I suspect it's Couriers Please attempting to cover themselves with their client Sendle, while Sendle are powerless to do anything over a third party driver/franchisee. Their customer service is too slow to respond to issues so when things do go wrong you're basically on your own. I wouldn't bother, I'd stick with Australia Post for your domestic parcels - cheaper and so much more reliable with live chat on the rare occasion you have an issue.","Aug 21, 2019",AU
1,Sendle cannot be trusted,"Sendle cannot be trusted, tracking gave my parcel as having been delivered with an authority to leave signed by their driver.

Then Sendle sent me estimated delivery dates and it's now the 15th and I still haven't got my parcel. I have been back and forth with their support team who are very vague and evasive about the process, none of which makes any sense. Twice now my tracking number shows the parcel on board for delivery, and neither has eventuated in delivery. I have never had such a terrible, slow experience, and there is really no excuse. I have no idea what the couriers are actually doing, but obviously they just get paid to sit around and do nothing. This is a corrupt company, and thanks to their slow service I will also have to give a negative review to the sender on ebay, because they were too cheap to just use AusPost. Ridiculous.","Aug 15, 2019",AU
1,Sendle often looses parcels or is late to deliver,Sendle is hit and miss. We've been using them for nearly 6 months now and have a high lost parcel rate.

Pricing is cheap though.,"Aug 08, 2019",AU

So rang back then found out the call needed to be escalated so the girl escalated requested that some one will contact you but guess what no one called me so I rang them again waisted all my day then the girl tells me that some one will ring me tomorrow not resolving any thing just they will give you a ring ....simply pathetic attitude since Monday this cycle is going still no sign of the parcel. Waisted all my time No one has a clue as to what they need to do been given a reference no after a reference no, a supervisor who doesn't want to speak to me and escalation team who doesn't ring you or your call can be transferred to. Drivers despite been given the number doesn't bother to let you know will they be delivering the package or notRequest after request still no result.Waisted 3 days I am the one chasing them no one bothering to even contact me.No customer service, have got bunch of young people answering the phones who have no clue as to what they are supposed to be doing highly disappointing attitude as if saying to you don't care you are frustrated so what we'll do what we want to do.","Jul 31, 2019",AU

Next day, same thing, and I’ve wasted two days at home at this point. Then they say they’ll reschedule for Friday and I even left the package outside: no one came, no one drove up to my unit, no one rang the bell. On Monday I wake up to an invoice for the package that was never even picked up. Then I read some reviews and decided to go with Au post because Sendle’s service sounds even worse when it comes to tracking and delivering (if that’s even possible!).

1,"Extremely slow, unreliable, and lack of support","Extremely slow, no support, no tracking. You are better off with AusPost, even they are faster and will provide the same level of tracking.My package from Perth to Vietnam is now 15 business days in, so much for their 6-13 business days. It disappeared for large periods of time because it went to Germany for some bizarre reason, hugely adding to the delay. And the support response was a joke when queried about it, not to mention their KB/documentation is awful about actually figuring out which carrier has it so you can get proper information. In future I will just go direct, why have Sendle take a cut off the top like a wholesaler when they can't even provide any actual value on top.And a package I am still yet to receive, from the east coast to Perth, 1-4 days shipping, 5 business days later, still not here, and still no tracking about where it is. Latest update I have was that it was picked up. But from the sounds of the reviews on here, that's actually pretty impressive, that it was actually picked up. I wish the seller had just used AusPost express cause Sendle clearly are skimping on costs.For whatever possible convince you might get from Sendle, you will be punished ten fold in poor service, delivery and overall customer experience.

After 18 days I was supplied with 'additional information' to see if i could find the parcel however the 'additional information' was just telling me that the driver has left it somewhere - which I already knew! I asked for them to be more specific but was told they could not provide any further info as they had already asked the driver.The parcel has now been marked as lost. Yes they have an insurance policy, however the excess is $100. So for my $65 purchase there is no point in the sender claiming. The sender is a small local company so i'm not going to go after them, especially when it's not their fault!I am now incredibly disappointed and down $65 (which is a LOT of money for some people!)Only positive is that the customer service team are very polite and are quick to respond.

1,worst courier company in Australia,"They have lost or stolen 4 parcels from us and just hand you from one so-called support  person , they are not really a courier company they are a booking agency.    on another review centre 1500 reviews 550 negative and we  have contacted a solicitor as we are going to take a class action against this company","Aug 27, 2018",AU
1,"Great for local shipments, but hopeless when it comes to international","I have been using Sendle for approximately 6 months for mostly domestic shipments. I was pretty excited when they announced they would be offering international shipping. I have since discovered, they just use normal post, and its VERY slow. I have a shipment picked up from Melbourne on May 25th, to be delivered to India. Its now June 26th, and the shipment has not arrived to my customer. Sendle advertise that the shipment will take 4-12 business days, which is a complete lie. I have requested Sendle to follow up with the shipment, but they tell me there is nothing that can be done. It has been sitting in the post office in India since June 6th. My customer in India is furious. Sendle are telling me to tell my customer to contact the local post office to arrange pick up. My customer has tried this a number of times, and the post office has stated that my customer needs to be patient, when the shipment is 'ready' he will be notified. Sendle have not been helpful, they are just hand-balling off the situation to me and my customer. I have requested for the items to be returned to Australia, so I can ship these through a company who can actually deliver in the promised time. Sendle have stated that they can't do this. I am now at my wits end. I have emailed Sendle numerous times about this. They take over 24 hours to respond to these particular emails - it is quite a coincidence that when I have a simple request, they respond within a few hours. They don't want to deal with the problem.","Jun 26, 2018",AU
1,Lost my items,"I have previously used sendle once before and they were great.Second time and I will never use them again!!!I requested a signature on delivery and triple checked the address was correct and they safe dropped it at the wrong house!After lodging a missing item case they looked for 10 days and couldn't find it. They did refund me the postage and mentioned they have a $100 excess therefore I couldn't claim the full amount I sold my item for.While they did reply promptly to my emails, not happy that I lost money when it was there fault.It's why I asked for a signature on delivery in the first place, it's not optional!How about providing a decent service and refunding me what I proved the person paid for it.Terrible service!! Now lost $100.. (items were worth well over $200, so lost over a $100 for value of item!)NEVER use them.","May 01, 2018",AU
1,"Worst company, questionable practices, no service, just headaches!","Worst company I have dealt with by far, very questionable practices. Organised 4 parcels for delivery. One pick up had to be cancelled as courier never picked up on two different dates, Sendle charged me for this even though not picked up. Second parcel damaged on arrival even though carefully packed.  Third parcel arrived to buyer extremely battered, amazingly the item was not damaged! Fourth parcel took 20 days to be delivered Melbourne > Woolongong, still waiting for info from the buyer about the condition of parcel! Lastly, Sendle overcharged my account considerably, double charges and triple charges, still waiting for overcharges to be refunded 13 days later. There is no contact phone number and email help system is all over the place with all different people replying, half of the responses very generic and really not answering your questions. this company is very unreliable and I would highly recommend that if you value the parcels you are sending, do not be deceived by their cheap rates, it will end up costing you much more than you anticipate in the way of reimbursing buyers and Sendle over charging when their couriers fail to pick up an item. Customers beware.","Apr 25, 2018",AU
1,I would not recommend this company to…,"I would not recommend this company to anyone, their email that says they get back to you in 8 business hours if there is a problem with the delivery of the parcel, complete falsehood!They subcontracted my parcel delivery to CouriersPlease, who are equally incompetent so my parcel has now been sitting at their depot for a week waiting for redelivery, everyday a different story why the driver can’t do the job. You can at least ring them unlike sendle who don’t have a phone number!!I would never buy from a company again who contracts out delivery to sendle","Apr 11, 2018",AU
1,Stay clear of this company at all costs!,"Stay clear of this company at all costs. No support, no service, no contact details, parcels go missing or aren't scanned therefore your customers aren't about to track them. They use unreliable carriers in the likes of Fastaway","Mar 24, 2018",AU
1,Appaling Customer Service,"Sendle''s customer service is absolutely appalling. And this is not the first time I have had a lack of communication from this company. It makes it extremely difficult to be able to inform your business clients the reason why for their severely delayed parcels,  when you have to wait ridiculous time frames for Sendle to contact you, so they can investigate what is happening. They do not give you a number to call, they have turned off visitor posts on their Facebook and also reviews (which to me says they must have a lot of unhappy customers) So my business customer who''s stock order is now 6 days overdue for delivery which was to go into gift baskets for Valentines day, will probably not arrive at all, meaning I have now more than likely lost a business client....","Feb 08, 2018",AU
1,unreliable,"unreliable, lost parcels, $100 excess for insurance even though Fastway Couriers (their main mail forwarder) has a $0 excess. all parcels 500g or less are marked ATL authority to leave, meaning even if it just goes in the bin, sendle refuse to ask fastway to investigate and they refuse to acknowledge there is even a problem. next price postage and australia post is cheaper and at very least are accountable for their mistake and have always reimbursed the costs.","Jan 24, 2018",AU
1,They lost my delivery. Not worth the hassle.,"I ordered a box of ethical toilet paper from Who Gives A Crap. The delivery was estimated to arrive between 15 - 19 Dec. When the parcel didn't arrive I assumed everyone was busy with Christmas so I gave them a few days grace before following up. They told me they assigned my job to Fastaway, Fastaway didn't know where my parcel had gone and they would look for it. I have been getting updates every few days since late December (it's now 15 Jan) telling me they are looking for the parcel and will get back to me soon. I finally got an email from Sendle today, telling me they can't find the parcel, they can't do any more for me and to contact Who Gives A Crap to arrange a replacement to be sent out. The hilarious part is that I spoke to Who Gives A Crap just over a week ago now, they apologised and said they would send a replacement out (I'm assuming via Sendle). The replacement was supposed to arrive mid last week. Guess what? This one hasn't arrived either!The staff at Sendle seem very nice but I can't give them more than one star as they literally have one job - to move parcels between the sender and the receiver and it doesn't appear they are very good at doing that.","Jan 15, 2018",AU
1,I would not even give them 1 star and I …,I would not even give them 1 star and I urge you not to use them2 out of 2 (separate) orders have disappeared and there is no way of tracking them.  Once Sendle flicks the parcel off to a third party the tracking number becomes worthless.  You can't phone them and they DO NOT reply to emails.  No customer service. No goods.  Sender is refunding my parcels and I will not use them again because of Sendle,"Dec 02, 2017",AU
